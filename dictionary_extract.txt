quiz 792 quote
geniuses —John Butt, English Literature in the MidEighteenth Century, edited & completed by Geoffrey
Carnall, 1979
In the middle of the 19th century there was some
reprehension of the use of quite before a and a noun—
Bache 1869, Richard Grant White 1870, and Ayres 1881
all objected, for instance. There were two bases for
objection: the commentators noticed that quite was not
an intensive in the expressions, and they did not believe
an adverb should modify a noun. Fitzedward Hall 1873
ignored the theoretical grammatical questions and was
content to produce evidence that the idiom had been in
use at least since the middle of the 18th century:
Quite a rake —Samuel Richardson, Pamela, 1740
(in Fitzedward Hall)
We decided, though, that he would be quite a swell
guy sober —James Thurber, letter, April 1936
Irene Franey, a little older than I, was quite a beauty
—John O'Hara, letter, 30 Dec. 1963
We have some British examples in which this quite a
has a clearly intensive function:
. . . the crow that must have been shot quite a month
before —Doreen Tovey, Cats in the Belfry, 1958
There are quite a dozen significant regional languages —W. B. Lockwood, A Panorama of IndoEuropean Languages, 1972
In these two examples quite means something like
"every bit of, fully."
Quite is also used before the:
"He was quite the picture of a middle-aged businessman," recalls William O. Bourke —Faye Rice, Fortune, 24 Nov. 1986
I am quite the wrong person to write this foreword
—Philip Larkin, Required Writing, 1983
These are established idioms, beyond cavil.
quiz Several critics feel that quiz is an informal word
which, as Bernstein 1965 puts it, "is best restricted to
the campus and the television screen." They particularly
object to its use, both as a noun and as a verb, in reference to a formal investigation or examination, as in a
criminal trial or by a legislative committee. Our evidence shows that such usage is extremely uncommon in
running text (it may well occur more often in headlines,
as the critics suggest). We have, in fact, only one bona
fide citation for it:
. . . the investigation into RFC lending policies, .. .
and currently the quiz on the extracurricular activities, if any, of Chairman Boyle of the Democratic
National Committee —Christian Science Monitor,
10 Oct. 1951
We do have a few citations in which the verb quiz is
used to describe close questioning in a police investigation, but not in a formal setting:
They quizzed the Forest Service lookouts in the area.
Some suspicious facts emerged —Frank Cameron,
Saturday Evening Post, 14 Aug. 1954
. . . he and Haquin went to quiz the crew of a patrol
car who had radioed in the report —Michael Butterworth, Cosmopolitan, January 1972
Such usage is entirely consistent with the verb's established sense, "to question closely."

quote 1. The noun quote, short for quotation, was first
recorded in 1888:
Stodgy 'quotes' from the ancients?
Gazette, 12 Dec. 1888 (OED)
-Pall Mall
One of its chief early uses was in the world of publishing
to denote a passage of favorable criticism quoted as
advertisement for a book:
. . . three sentences that might have been framed specially to give the publisher an easy 'quote' —Century
Mag., February 1919
Its occurrence in general contexts was fairly rare until
the 1940s, when we found it being used in a number of
popular newspapers and magazines and very often without the distancing quotation marks of earlier years:
Miss Ross works with quotes from letters and diaries
—Ernestine Evans, N. Y. Herald Tribune Book Rev.,
15 Oct. 1944
With a quote from the Troy Times —Ben Lucien
Burman, Saturday Rev., 28 Dec. 1946
. . . a distorted quote from a speech before the Congress of American-Soviet Friendship —Atlantic,
August 1948
. . . riddles his opposition with a salvo of quotes —
Richard E. Lauterbach, New Republic, 11 Apr. 1949
. . . some witty quotes picked from their own works
—Time, 18 Apr. 1949
Its use since the 1940s has continued to be common
and, for the most part, unremarkable. It occurs most
often in writing that has a casual tone or, at least, is not
highly formal:
It was mighty thoughtful of you to send me that
quote from dear old Sam Adams's letter —James
Thurber, letter, 3 Dec. 1958
. . . he said something to the effect that sex should be
used sparingly, and refused to give Harcourt, Brace
a quote for an ad —John O'Hara, letter, 9 Dec. 1961
To put quotes in the mouths of living people —Seymour Krim, Evergreen, August 1967
It started with quotes taken out of context —Suzette
Haden Elgin, English Jour., November 1976
. . . is obvious even before the quotes are collected
—David Harris, N.Y. Times Mag., 9 Mar. 1980
Only after the sweat has dried comes the quote —
Wilfrid Sheed, Harper's, February 1984
This sense of quote has met with strong disapproval
in some quarters. Such commentators as Bernstein
1965, Follett 1966, Shaw 1975, and Trimmer &
McCrimmon 1988 have disparaged its use in writing,
and the Heritage 1969, 1982 usage panel rejected it by a
large majority. Some other critics, however, have taken
a more tolerant view. Harper 1985, for example, accepts
its use in writing that has "a conversational tone";
Bremner 1980 calls it "standard in the publishing business"; and The Right Handbook 1986 suggests that
quoth 793 racket
"probably only purists" insist on distinguishing between
quote and quotation.
The noun quote is now widely used in standard if
mostly casual writing, as the above quotations show, but
there are still times when it seems more appropriate to
choose quotation instead (as we have in writing this sentence). We recommend that you let your own judgment
of the writing situation and your sense of idiom be your
guide.
2. The noun quote is also used to mean "quotation
mark," and it has also been criticized in this sense. Like
the "quotation" sense, this "mark" sense is about 100
years old:
The portion of this quotation which we have put
within quotes —Scottish Leader, 2 Apr. 1891 (OED)
Its use in American English is well established:
. . . quotes within quotes are often confusing, and
unhinge the minds of thousands of poor copy-readers every year —H. L. Mencken, The American Language, Supplement II, 1948
The written contexts in which it appears are similar in
tone to those in which the "quotation" sense of quote
appears. Those critics who dislike the "quotation" sense
tend naturally to dislike the "quotation mark" sense as
well. Again, we recommend that you rely on your own
judgment.
quoth Quoth is the past tense of an obsolete verb
quethen. It is used in the first and third persons and is
regularly followed by its subject. It is archaic as a regular
verb form and is used nowadays in special contexts,
such as when a writer of historical fiction tries to recreate the speech and atmosphere of an earlier time. It is
also sometimes used in modern contexts for humorous
or arch effect or simply to catch attention:
"That's all right, Dad," quoth he —Martin Mayer,
Esquire, May 1974
Then the mayor labored mightily and brought forth
an "austerity" budget. Not good enough, quoth the
bankers —Sidney Cohen, Harper's Weekly, 4 July
1975

rack, wrack The prescriptions of the critics are usually stated along the following lines: the verb rack,
which is related to the noun designating an instrument
of torture, properly means "strain" or "torment" and is
the correct choice in nerve-racking, rack one's brains,
and similar expressions; the verb wrack and noun
wrack, on the other hand, are etymologically related to
wreck and should therefore be used when wreckage or
destruction is being described, as in storm-wracked and
wrack and ruin.
The facts of actual usage are somewhat different.
Wrack is commonly used as a verb synonymous with
the figurative senses of rack:
Perpetual longing perpetually denied was too wracking —Amy Lowell, John Keats, 1925
. . . if a society is wracked with internal conflicts —
Kenneth E. Boulding, Center Mag., May/June 1971
. . . a world wracked by change —Harrison E. Salisbury, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 6 Nov. 1966
. . . wracking his brain for the next day's copy —William Irvin, Saturday Rev., 24 Dec. 1955
Nerve-wracking is an established variant of nerveracking:
. . . a business more nerve-wracking and exhausting
than reading a newspaper —H. L. Mencken, Prejudices: Second Series, 1920
. . . nerve-wracking period —John Gunther, Inside
Europe, rev. éd., 1937
. . . less nerve-wracking —Richard J. Barnet, N. Y.
Times Book Rev., 17 Oct. 1976
. . . this nerve-wracking chapter in so many American lives —Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Saturday
Rev., 6 Jan. 1979
The noun rack is sometimes used as a synonym of
wrack, especially in the phrase rack and ruin:
. . . the Bank was going to rack and ruin without him
—Rudyard Kipling, Plain Tales from the Hills, 1888
. . . let the business go to rack and ruin —Punch, 15
June 1966
Wrack (verb) meaning rack was first recorded in
1553, rack (noun) meaning wrack was first recorded in
1599. The tendency among modern commentators is to
regard rack and ruin as acceptable, but to persist in
regarding such usage as "he wracked his brain" as incorrect. Why one should be acceptable and the other unacceptable is not easily discerned. Probably the most sensible attitude would be to ignore the etymologies of rack
and wrack (which, of course, is exactly what most people do) and regard them simply as spelling variants of
one word. If you choose to toe the line drawn by the
commentators, however, you will want to write nerveracking, rack one's brains, storm-wracked, and for good
measure wrack and ruin. Then you will have nothing to
worry about being criticized for—except, of course, for
using too many clichés.
racket, racquet These spelling variants are both
established in reputable use:
. . . hoisted his racket to his shoulder like a baseball
bat —John Updike, Couples, 1968
. . . I grabbed a tennis racquet hanging in its press —
E. L. Doctorow, Loon Lake, 1979
Racket is appreciably the more common of the two
except when the reference is to the game racquets, which
in American English is usually spelled as we have
spelled it here:
Racquets today is almost as aristocratic a game as
court tennis —Dick Miller et al., Town & Country,
May 1984
railroad 794 raise
The British, however, prefer rackets for the name of the
game:
. . . recorded the double in the .. . tennis and rackets
competitions at Manchester yesterday —The Times
(London), 29 Oct. 1973
The British preference may be partly attributable to the
opinions of such commentators as Partridge 1942 and
Gowers in Fowler 1965, both of whom treat racquet as
a spelling error. Racquet is, in fact, something of a
strange hybrid, combining the English racket with the
French raquette. But its use dates back to the early 19th
century, and it has long been recognized as a standard
variant in both British and American dictionaries.
railroad, railway There is no usage controversy
involving railroad and railway, but several commentators have pointed out—and our evidence confirms—
that railway is the word used in British English. The first
of these examples is from a New Zealander:
. . . the railway waiting rooms came to be looked
upon as dormitories —Frank Sargeson, Once Is
Enough, 1973
. . . undermine subsidised railway systems —The
Economist, 16 May 1986
Railroad and railway are both used in American
English, and are essentially interchangeable. Railroad is
considerably more common than railway in the U.S.,
except that railway is more likely to be used when the
reference is to an actual set of tracks rather than a system of transportation:
An ornate little car on an incline railway glides
between the parking lot and the top level of the restaurant —Paul Showers, N.Y. Times, 10 Apr. 1977
raise, rear "I thought we raise plants & animals and
rear children?" This query on a proof received from our
typesetters in late 1985 is evidence of the hardiness of
this old issue.
The Dictionary of American English says that raise
used of children had some currency in British English at
one time, but that it dropped out of use around 1800. It
did not drop out of use in North America; the OED
labels the sense Now chiefly U.S. The OED Supplement
has a couple of recent British citations that associate
raise with the United States, but almost all of the evidence from John Adams to the present is American.
The disappearance of the use in British English made
the usage noticeable, and it was criticized as provincial
as early as 1818. Bache 1869 quotes Dr. Alfred L. Elwyn,
who published a book on Americanisms in 1859, to the
effect that raise is a Southernism. Bache himself finds it
"certainly no longer confined to the Southern States"
but considers rear or bring up "the preferable expression." Vizetelly attacked raise in both his 1906 book and
the Funk & Wagnalls dictionary. In the book he says it
is "often misapplied to the bringing up of human beings.
One rears cattle, raises chickens, but brings up children.
Rear, meaning 'to nurture and train,' may also be used
of children." Many subsequent commentators, and
many, many schoolteachers, have followed his prescription, although bring up is fairly often overlooked.
Raise, however, never dropped out of use despite the
disapproval, and most modern commentators recognize
that it is perfectly standard American, although still
apparently not used in Great Britain. A few commentators, such as Kilpatrick 1984 and Jacques Barzun
(quoted in Safire 1986), still follow the Vizetelly line.
But as these examples show, raise is both perfectly
respectable and still very common in the Southern U.S.
. . . I was not trying to say, This is the sort of folks
we raise in my part of Mississippi —William Faulkner, 15 May 1958, in Faulkner in the University,
1959
I told my mother I'd changed my mind about wanting to succeed in the magazine business. "If you
think I'm going to raise a good-for-nothing," she
replied, "you've got another think coming." —Russell Baker, Growing Up, 1982
Cousin Katie left me the house in Savannah I was
raised in —Flannery O'Connor, letter, 15 Feb. 1959
. . . the town where I was born and raised —William
Styron, This Quiet Dust and Other Writings, 1982
Both parents are now more often engaged in active,
day-to-day childraising —Elizabeth Janeway, in
Harper 1985
Raised poor in Tennessee by a religious mother —
Geoffrey Wolff, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 21 Nov. 1982
. . . she might at the same time be raising a family of
her own —Peter Taylor, The Old Forest and Other
Stories, 1985
For Eliot, nonetheless, it was a very great advantage
to have been raised in an atmosphere of evangelical
piety —Irving Howe, New Republic, 18 Oct. 1954
Every youngster as he grows up knows he was a
darned sight smarter than his daddy was, and he has
to get to be about forty before he finds out the old
man was smart enough to raise him —Harry S. Truman, quoted in Merle Miller, Plain Speaking, 1973
Rear is still in common use too, and it varies freely with
raise in the word-stock of some writers:
She'd reared her children there —Russell Baker,
Growing Up, 1982
Born and reared in South Carolina —William Styron, This Quiet Dust and Other Writings, 1982
. . . where Macon's grandfather, a factory owner,
reared his four grandchildren —John Updike, New
Yorker, 28 Oct. 1985
She reared the kids and kept the house clean —
Edwards Park, Smithsonian, February 1986
Barkley kept looking at him and wondering if the
gentleman could have been reared in Egypt —Harry
S. Truman, letter, 28 Jan. 1952
raise, rise 1. Verb. It is an axiom of about twenty
handbooks in our collection—mostly but not exclusively those aimed at a school and college audience—
that raise is only transitive. A transitive raise and an
intransitive rise make for a tidy world. Unfortunately
the matter is a little more complicated than that. By and
large raise and rise do form a transitive-intransitive
pair; however, raise can also be an intransitive verb.
Intransitive raise has been objected to from as far
back as Bache 1869, even though intransitive uses date
to the 15th century in the works of Malory and Caxton.
But it seems to have dropped out of mainstream British
raising 795 raising
English before the end of the 18th century; the historian
David Hume—and he was a Scot—is the last (1761) literary figure quoted in the OED. It stayed alive, however,
in dialectal use and in America:
The Water having raised, .. . I could form no accurate judgment of the progress —George Washington,
diary, 22 Sept. 1785 (in OED Supplement)
George Washington's use can still be found in American
regional English:
. . . and whenever there was much rain, and the river
went to raising, I couldn't do my work —Elbert Herald, quoted in Our Appalachia, ed. Laurel Shackleford & Bill Weinberg, 1977
Our evidence shows four chief uses of the intransitive
raise. They are not all regional, although the one which
means "to get up out of bed" may be. It is found in the
journals of Lewis and Clark in the early 19th century
and also more recently:
. . . Simon was beating the bottom of the dishpan
with the spoon, hollering, "Raise up and get your
four-o'clock coffee!" —William Faulkner, Saturday
Evening Post, 5 Mar. 1955
There is also a use in which the intransitive is the
semantic equivalent of a passive:
He wants Britain's beet quota raising from 900,000
tons to 1,200,000 tons a year —The Sun (London),
22 Oct. 1974
The flashlights momentarily converged on the dog,
then raised —Erie Stanley Gardner, The Case of the
Negligent Nymph, 1949
Another pattern finds raise used as if a reflexive pronoun object had been omitted from a transitive
construction:
At Bledsoe's defiance, he half raised from his seat
and ejaculated, "The son of a bitch!" —Alexander
Woollcott, letter, 23 Feb. 1933
He periodically raised up on his elbows and fired —
NY. Times, 24 Apr. 1970
Uncle Jake was stirring unconsciously in the chair as
he spoke, and I raised up from his lap and peered
across the tablecloth into father's face —Peter Taylor, The Old Forest and Other Stories, 1985
And, finally, raise is simply used in place of various senses of rise:
... perhaps it was the distraction of the drama which
prevented him raising any higher on the moving
staircase of public service —Laurence Irving, Henry
Irving: The Actor and His World, 1952
A blade [of a screwdriver] which tapers out from the
tip .. . has a tendency to raise out of the slot —General Motors Corp., ABC's of Hand Tools, 1945
The intransitive raise was labeled obsolete in some
older dictionaries, but it is still alive in dialectal use and
in some at least sporadic general use. It is not incorrect
nor illiterate. It seems rather to be a little-used survival
from the past.
2. Noun. Vizetelly 1906 and others of similar vintage
objected to the noun raise used in the sense "an increase
in pay." Rise, which is still the usual word in British
English, was prescribed. The prescription survived long
enough in some newspaper stylebooks to receive mention in Harper 1975, 1985. But raise is standard in this
sense in America.
raising Raising is a term used by linguists for the idiomatic shifting of a subject or a negative from a subordinate clause to the "higher" clause it is dependent on
(Bolinger 1980). The more important phenomenon, for
usage writers (who do not use the term raising), is the
one in which a negative is shifted.
Let's take an example:
But I suppose I oughtn't to say that.
Does that seem a bit stiff and awkward? The most likely
pattern in present-day English would show the negative
shifted from ought, where it logically belongs, to the
verb of the main clause:
. . . but I don't suppose I ought to say that —Harry
S. Truman, quoted in Merle Miller, Plain Speaking,
1973
Some of the most common expressions in which negative-raising is usual involve verbs like think, suppose,
believe, and seem. The sentences "I don't think it will
rain" and "I don't believe I'll go" were disapproved as
solecisms by Vizetelly 1906. The objection was, of
course, that the raised negatives are illogical. Illogical
they may be, perhaps, but standard idioms nonetheless—especially in speech and relaxed writing. Flesch
1964 and Bolinger 1980 bother to defend them, so there
evidently has been a fair amount of objection along
Vizetelly's lines. Here are some examples of raising:
I don't suppose there is much room to doubt that we
will be actually at war before another fortnight is out
—Archibald MacLeish, letter, 4 Feb. 1917
I don't suppose there was a scarcer or more highly
prized item in all of Belgium —And More by Andy
Rooney, 1982
"I don't suppose you remembered that bagel,"
Megan says —Jay Mclnerney, Bright Lights, Big
City, 1984
Well, I don't think the writer finds peace —William
Faulkner, 13 Mar. 1958, in Faulkner in the University, 1959
I don't think those things fall in the same category
—Senator Lowell Weicker, radio interview, 28 Nov.
1975
. . . he says that he doesn't think he's going to like
"your chapter on editing" —James Thurber, letter, 3
Dec. 1958
The roar of the traffic and continual street and building construction don't seem to faze the sidewalk cafe
devotee —Barbara Gamarekian, N. Y. Times, 7 May
1978
. . . for as he did not seem in the least to lessen his
Affection to me, so neither did he lessen his Bounty
—Daniel Defoe, Moll Flanders, 1722
. . . I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem;
I couldn't seem to reach him any other way —F.
Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby, 1925
Never is also raised sometimes. Vizetelly 1906 complains of one example, and Phythian 1979 corrects "I
raison d'être 796 rather
never expected to find it" to "I expected never to find
it." But the raised position has long been established:
. . . though 'Gondibert' never appears to have been
popular —Samuel Johnson, Life ofDryden, 1783 (in
Fitzedward Hall 1873)
Objections to idioms like / don't think or can't seem
(unfavorably noticed from Schele de Vere 1872 to Shaw
1987) are a waste of good indignation; English idiom
simply defies the dictates of abstract logic at some
points, and this is one of them.
See also CAN'T SEEM.
raison d'être This French term, meaning literally
"reason for being," is commonly used to refer to the
fundamental purpose of something (or someone) or to
an original and central cause or justification:
When the seat of State government was removed to
Annapolis in 1695, the town lost its raison d'être —
James F. Waesche, Maryland Mag., Autumn 1971
. . . the March of Dimes, having lost its raison d'être,
switched from polio to arthritis —John L. Hess &
Karen Hess, The Taste of America, 1977
Because its intrinsic Frenchness is so apparent, the term
is sometimes written in italics:
UNESCO's very raison d'être—the widening of
man's cultural and scientific horizons —Katharine
Kuh, Saturday Rev., 24 Jan. 1976
Fowler 1926 cites as an error a passage in which raison d'être is used to mean simply "reason." Evans 1957
calls such use "an affectation" and also criticizes the use
of raison d'être to mean "explanation." We have no evidence in our files for either of the criticized uses.
range Bernstein 1965 states flatly that range (presumably the verb) takes the prepositions through, with,
along, or between. Why he chooses to specify those four
is unclear. Our evidence shows that range is idiomatically followed by a great many prepositions—so many,
in fact, that to list and illustrate all of them would serve
no useful purpose. Suffice it to say that you need not
agonize over the choice of prepositions following range.
It may be worth noting that by far the most common
preposition to follow range is one not included in Bernstein's list, namely from:
... ranging from lock-pickers through photographers
to psychiatrists —Times Literary Supp., 2 July 1971
. . . ranging from a whisper to a bray —Susan
Braudy, Ms., March 1973
rarefy, rarify Rarefy is the usual spelling, but rarify
has been in use as a variant since the 15th century. The
earliest citations in the OED for this word, in fact, show
it spelled with an -/-. Examples of the -/- spelling in standard, edited prose are extremely easy to come by:
. . . in an increasingly rarified atmosphere —Walter
Millis, Center Mag., January 1968
. . . by rarified philosophical speculation —Times
Literary Supp., 18 Dec. 1969
. . . how one rarified precedent may .. . follow from
another —David Riley, The Washingtonian,
November 1970
. . . the rarified chambers of the museum —Susan
Sidlauskas, Vogue, June 1982
His suits are off the peg, and not a rarified peg —
Diane Sustendal, N.Y. Times Mag, 25 Mar. 1984
Nevertheless, rarify is widely regarded as a spelling
error, so if you want to avoid possible criticism, however mild, we recommend that you choose the more
common spelling, rarefy.
rarely ever Rarely ever is one of several intensive
forms of the adverb rarely. Bryant 1962 calls it an established colloquial idiom, which agrees with our evidence.
The idiom is possibly a telescoped form of rarely if ever,
an intensified form of rarely that is more common in
print, but the historical evidence is against this conjecture. OED evidence dates rarely ever from 1694; rarely
if ever from 1756. Rarely ever is used in both British and
American English:
. . . and the thieves are rarely ever caught —magistrate quoted in Ronald Blythe, Akenfield, 1969
I rarely ever think about the past —Edmund Wilson,
New Yorker, 12 June 1971
The longer intensive forms of rarely include rarely if
at all (cited in Bryant), rarely or never (Bryant and
OED), and rarely if ever, the best-attested version in our
files. It is used with or without commas:
In all the hullabaloo about Justice Douglas we rarely,
if ever, told our readers .. . —Theodore Bernstein,
Winners & Sinners, 30 Apr. 1970
. . . says it rarely if ever sees a repeat shoplifting
offender —Glynn Mapes, Security World, May
1968
The criticism of rarely ever takes some strange forms.
One critic calls it "wordy, unidiomatic." How a 300-
year-old idiom can be unidiomatic he does not say. As
to wordiness, this critic suggests you replace rarely ever
with hardly ever, rarely, if ever, or rarely or never.
Criticism of rarely ever can be ignored; Bryant has the
right idea. In ordinary discursive prose, however, rarely
is almost always used alone.
rarify See RAREFY, RARIFY.
rather 1. See HAD RATHER.
2. Rather is used both as a mild intensifier and as a mild
de-emphasizer. The intensifier:
He considers Pappy rather small potatoes —Harry S.
Truman, diary, 10 Aug. 1945
The de-emphasizer:
. . . led a rather lonely but not altogether unhappy
childhood —Current Biography, November 1965
In this respect rather operates much like quite (which
see).
The use of rather in its diluting or softening function
has drawn a smattering of criticism objecting to its use
with words (usually adjectives) that are "warm" (Fowler
1926) or "strong, affirmative" (Copperud 1970). In spite
of the comment in Copperud 1964, 1970, 1980, Fowler
1926, 1965, Follett 1966, and Janis 1984, we cannot find
much basis for their objections; examples of the sort
rather than 797 rather than
they bring forth are hard to find in our files. Here are a
few of our examples:
. . . in the late 1950's there came a rather dramatic
swing in another direction —William G. Moulton,
NEA Jour., January 1965
Delhi has had a problem with some rather ferocious
monkeys —Peter Thomson, quoted in Sports Illustrated, 15 July 1968
. . . and an occasional quarrel... was rather fun —
Edward Seidensticker, Low City, High City, 1983
. . . would have looked down their aristocratic noses
to see rather middle class men and women drinking
sherry .. . in their rooms —Suzanne Wilding, Town
& Country, June 1976
I read a little Samuel Pepys, rather like it —Renata
Adler, Pitch Dark, 1983
The other stories in this volume are rather more
cheerful —Times Literary Supp., 16 Apr. 1970
I was becoming rather cross by this time —Graham
Greene, Travels with My Aunt, 1969
You write rather well and if you are interested I
think I can get you a job as a cub reporter —Groucho
Marx, undated letter to Goodman Ace, in The
Groucho Letters, 1967
These examples are typical of our file on rather m its use
as a softening qualifier, and they seem fully acceptable
to us. It is hard to see what the problem is supposed to
be.
3. Rather a. Phythian 1979 and Partridge 1942 offer
some remarks on the proper employment of rather a
before a noun. The concern here does not seem to be the
old objection to quite a, some critics claiming it was
improper for an adverb to qualify a noun, but to the
retention of the word order with the adverb before the
article when an adjective intervenes between rather a
and the noun. Both Partridge and Phythian accept
rather a with no adjective:
. . . it was rather a relief when the narcotics testimony ended —Richard Dougherty, Atlantic, February 1972
They prescribe a rather when an adjective intervenes:
. . . inside a rather larger plastic fish tank —Charles
Baptist-Smith, Observer Mag., 3 Feb. 1974
But we find that some writers retain the inverted order:
. . . the French could make rather a good counterargument —Stephen E. Ambrose, Johns Hopkins
Mag., April 1966
It was rather an unbelievable example of using excessive means —Hannah Arendt, NY. Rev. of Books,
18 Nov. 1971
He is rather a worried participant in the custom —
Richard Poirier, A World Elsewhere, 1966
The writers who keep the inverted order rather a in
front of an adjective probably do so because they feel
that the form is slightly more emphatic: "rather a good
counter-argument" being felt to be stronger than "a
rather good counter-argument." This, then, is not a matter of right and wrong; both orders are completely
respectable. We suggest you make your choice with discretion; most of our examples follow the prescribed
word order.
rather than 1 . A knowledge of traditional grammar
can lead the usage commentator astray. In the Latin
grammar that traditional English grammar is based on,
a word that is a conjunction can almost never be a preposition as well. English, however, is not bound by the
limitations of Latin; many English words function as
more than one part of speech. And English compound
function words are especially slippery. It is often very
hard to tell whether as well as or other than is working
as a preposition or a conjunction or just as a combination of individual words. It is just this slipperiness that
brings rather than up as a subject in Fowler 1926, 1965,
Bremner 1980, Janis 1984, and Cook 1985. The question that puzzled Fowler was whether rather than always
operated as a conjunction and thus had the same construction before as it had after, or whether it could also
operate as a preposition and so connect dissimilar
constructions.
We will not go into all of Fowler's thinking on this
subject. We will simply point out that rather than does
function like a preposition:
Rather than being so quick to knock an attempt at
change, Mr. Rustin should extend it the same leeway
. . . —Burrill L. Crohn, letter to the editor, Harper's,
April 1970
Rather than argue for the overthrow of the entire system, the Colonists realized .. . that the basic values
of British law were still valid —Daniel Sisson, Center Mag., May 1969
Is there any chance of spring publication, rather than
waiting till fall? —E. B. White, letter, 28 Jan. 1942
In the most apparent prepositional use of rather than, it
is followed by a gerund; in such use rather than frequently begins a sentence:
Rather than permitting us to imagine..., Lindblom
forces us to consider... —N. Y. Times Book Rev., 19
Feb. 1978
But when parallel constructions appear on each side
of rather than, it is functioning like a conjunction:
. . . implicating them, this time subtly rather than
powerfully —J. I. M. Stewart, Eight Modern Writers,
1963
. . . speaking of her as a person rather than as an
actress —Current Biography, September 1964
. . . for the sake of dramatic convenience rather than
for motives that appeal to reason —John Butt,
English Literature in the Mid-Eighteenth Century,
edited & completed by Geoffrey Carnall, 1979
. . . they cause young people to think and reason
rather than just «it and listen —Albert F. Eiss & Carolyn Mulford, NEA Jour., November 1965
. . . I define the language by the literature in which it
appears, rather than the literature by the language it
employs —W. F. Bolton, A Short History of Literary
English, 1967
We have met with the conjunctive use somewhat more
often than the prepositional use; both are used in standard English.
ravage 798 reaction
2. Commentators from Partridge 1942 to Janis 1984
and Cook 1985 notice a curious construction in which
a comparative that you would expect to be followed
by than takes rather than instead. Here are two examples:
All this was new to him, his experience having made
him more knowing about bookies rather than books
—John Ferguson, Death of Mr. Dodsley, 1937 (in
Partridge)
The group is more interested in the edible varieties
and in experimenting with recipes rather than in pursuing rare specimens —N. Y. Times, 29 Dec. 1970 (in
Winners & Sinners, 14 Jan. 1971)
Bernstein 1977 rejected these constructions on the basis
of rather's etymology—it is the comparative of an obsolete adverb, but etymology is not really the point. The
reason for the awkwardness of the sentences is that the
more in each sentence leads the reader to expect the
usual than, but rather than turns up in its place. The
existence of such sentences (which we advise you to
avoid) is good evidence that rather than is perceived as
a unit by many writers. We lexicographers will, in time,
have to recognize its existence.
For the controversy over rather than after prefer, see
PREFER.
ravage, ravish Both of these verbs are ultimately
derived from the same Middle French verb, ravir, but
their fundamental meanings are distinct. Ravage has the
basic sense "to plunder or destroy":
The war would ravage two particular reputations:
Johnson's and McNamara's —David Halberstam,
Harper's, February 1971
. . . as the coal company's power shovels ravage the
land around them —H. L. Van Brunt, Saturday
Rev., 8 Apr. 1972
Ravish has three primary senses—"to seize and carry
away":
The food was ravished by the semi-wild, emaciated
cat —Dave Lee, Cats Mag., July 1980
"to overcome with emotion (as joy or delight)":
Bellow is ravished by Alexandra's exotic .. . celebrity —Richard Stern, N.Y. Times Mag., 21 Nov.
1976
and "to rape":
. . . brutally ravished her in a lower berth —Time, 3
Jan. 1955
As many commentators have noted, ravage and ravish
are easily confused, although our evidence suggests that
errors are rare in edited writing. We have only a few
clear-cut examples:
. .. coming whenever he wanted to ravage her —
James T. Farrell, What Time Collects, 1964
. . . a mountain torrent ravishes his potato field —
Saturday Rev., 29 Mar. 1952
If you feel uncertain about which word to use in a particular context, a quick look in the dictionary will clear
things up.
It should be noted that ravish also has the rare sense
"to plunder or rob."
.. . slaves and concubines ravished from the Pecos
people —Willa Cather, Death Comes for the Archbishop, 1927
Buccaneer Henry Morgan, ravishing Panama of
400,000 pieces of eight in 1671 —Time, 24 Aug.
1953
Used in this sense, ravish resembles ravage closely
enough that it may give the appearance of confusion
even when none exists. That being so, you may well
want to avoid this sense of ravish.
re This preposition was borrowed straight from Latin
in the 18th century. It has some use in legal and business
writing, but the usage books (for instance Harper 1975,
1985, Bernstein 1965, Flesch 1964, Copperud 1964,
1970, 1980, Irmscher 1976, Shaw 1975, 1987) tell everyone else to avoid it. Harper, for instance, calls it "pretentious in nonbusiness or nonlegal situations"; nonetheless, it is used in the book:
(He voted "no" re writing.) —Harper 1985
The evidence in our files shows that re is not a highfrequency word but has more general use than the usage
writers suppose:
. . . fortunate or unfortunate enough to have something very like fanatical convictions re métier —Ezra
Pound, Polite Essays, 1937
I have no idea what Don Regan knows or does not
know re my private U.S. operation —Oliver North,
quoted in The Tower Commission Report, 1987
. . . as low as you can get re fiction —Flannery
O'Connor, letter, 31 May 1960
Snow, who has come back to rendezvous with
Abbott and Angel re a new musical —Martin Levin,
N. Y. Times Book Rev., 24 June 1973
Call the Waterville Valley Resort Association .. . re
inns and rental condominiums —Barbara Walder,
New York, 15 Nov. 1976
It is only occasionally italicized in general contexts.
reaction There has been a considerable reaction
against reaction used, as it often is in print and electronic journalism, as a sort of rough equivalent of
response, feeling, or opinion. It usually turns up after
something has been said, done, or produced:
. . . the critical reaction was no warmer than pessimistic rumor had predicted —Current Biography,
April 1966
. . . the nature books .. . during the past three or four
years have had a mixed reaction —Jude Bell, N. Y.
Times Book Rev., 19 Sept. 1976
On the two evening news shows I watched, Mr. Ford
got as much time as a local crime story; one station
even filmed the reaction in a downtown tavern —
Karl E. Meyer, Saturday Rev., 20 Mar. 1976
In no instance can I remember opposition Congressmen . .. ever having been brought into a studio for
reaction following a news conference —Robert Goralski, Johns Hopkins Mag., Spring 1971
. . . asking for comments and reaction to the black
students' criticisms —Bowdoin Alumnus, January
1971
read where 799 reason is because
. . . but I feel that using the score from a movie for
the celebration of the Lord's supper borders on the
profane. What is your reaction? —Amy Vanderbilt,
Ladies' Home Jour., September 1971
More than half the critics say something to the effect
that reaction is a scientific word and should not be used
of people, an opinion that conveniently overlooks
nearly two centuries of use as a political term in such
expressions as "the forces of progress and reaction."
Reaction has been used figuratively in various senses
since Sir Thomas Browne in 1643. There is no reason
to restrict its use to scientific contexts (in which, to be
sure, it is frequently used), even if it becomes, at times,
a tiresome cliché of the journalist. You can substitute some other word—response, opinion, judgment,
view, or the like—if you think that reaction is overused. But the word has its own meaning and overtones, and it is not easily expendable in every circumstance.
Bremner 1980 and Bryson 1984 say that if you must
use reaction, you should restrict its meaning to an
immediate response to the event. This is eminently sensible advice, but we must observe that writers ignore it
as often as they follow it.

real The adverb real, which is used only as an intensifier, developed from a use of the adjective to modify
compound noun phrases like good turn. By the 18th century the real was apprehended as an intensifier modifying good alone, and its independent use grew from then.
It was a development that took place, apparently, outside of mainstream British English; the OED identifies
it as chiefly Scottish and American, and we have some
slight Irish evidence. It has been from the start primarily
a spoken use.
Criticism of the adverbial real began as early as Ayres
1881, and it has not begun to drop off yet. Insofar as this
criticism tells you that real is informal and more suitable to speech than to writing, it is fairly accurate. When
it wanders from this line to insist that real is an adjective only, or that real is a substitute for really, it is
wrong. It is potentially misleading to label real as an
error for really, because real and really are not very
often used in the same way. Real is a simple intensifier,
more or less equivalent to very; it is used only with
adjectives and adverbs. Really is a full-fledged adverb;
it is only sometimes used in an intensive function, and
even then is more likely to mean "truly, unquestionably" than simply "very." The handbook writer who set
forth "My aunt is really ill" and "My aunt is real ill" as
synonymous is mistaken. The difference can perhaps be
suggested by this passage from an interview published
in a University of Minnesota publication:
You work at writing for a couple of years and you
get to feeling real sociable. By the end of a day spent
sitting in a room with a typewriter, you're really
ready to meet and greet and go hang out with your
friends —Garrison Keillor, quoted in Update (Univ.
of Minn.), Fall 1981
We should add here a word about speech and writing.
While it is still true that real is more likely to be encountered in speech than in writing, we notice that it has
spread considerably in general writing—primarily that
of newspapers and magazines—as a part of an informal,
conversational style.
A booth with a real different look was set up by a Los
Gatos, Calif, shop —Antiques and the Arts Weekly,
3 Dec. 1982
. . . he didn't follow politics real closely —Larry
Pressler, People, 12 July 1982

reason is because Bremner 1980 succinctly states
two objections to the reason is because:
The grammatical reason for the error in "The reason
he failed is because he didn't study" is that the reason is calls for a nounal clause: "The reason he failed *
is that he didn't study." The adverbial conjunction
because is correct in "He failed because he didn't
study."
A simpler reason is that because means "for the
reason that" and therefore one would be saying,
reason is because 800 reason is because
"The reason he failed is for the reason that .. . ,"
which is as redundant as saying "The because is
because."
Bremner's first objection is a 20th-century one; the second is older. The grammatical objection that because
can only introduce an adverbial clause qualifying a verb
and hence is wrong introducing a noun clause synonymous with reason was presumably erected to buttress
the older objection, but who first formulated it we do
not know. It is, however, mentioned in Fowler 1926,
Utter 1916, and MacCracken & Sandison 1917.
Evans 1957 offers the best treatment of the grammatical question. He notes that because in most cases introduces a clause that qualifies a verb and is therefore said
to be an adverbial conjunction. He also notes that some
grammarians claim that because cannot be used in any
other way and especially that it cannot introduce a noun
clause. But Evans disagrees:
Because may certainly introduce a noun clause that
is joined to it, this, or that by some form of the verb
to be, as in if you are hungry it is because you didn 't
eat. This has been standard English for centuries and
the very grammarians who condemn the use of
because in a noun clause do not hesitate to write this
is because.
One of those objecting grammarians was H. W. Fowler,
and he indeed did use because after is to introduce a
noun clause:
There is indeed no mystery about why people go
wrong; it is because, if the thing had to be said without the use of the verb like, would & not should is
the form to use —Fowler 1926, s.v. like, v.
And if because can refer to a pronoun like it, this, or
that, Evans continues, there is no reason it should not
refer to a noun like reason.
In other words, the grammatical objection has no
basis in principle. It is erected ad hoc to rationalize dislike of the reason is because and is not invoked in other
cases where because introduces a noun clause. But this
has not prevented commentators from repeating the
assertion or from defending it. In American Speech,
February 1933, Fannye N. Cherry of the University of
Texas established the standardness of is because by producing 31 citations of the construction from writers
from Samuel Johnson to Robert Benchley; many wellknown 19th-century writers such as Poe, Hawthorne,
Thackeray, Hardy, Scott, and Stevenson were included.
She also had examples of the reason is because from
Bacon, Swift, and Addison.
So with the grammatical argument disposed of, the
objectors must get along with the older charge of redundancy (as most of them do anyway). Bremner's summary is both succinct and apt, for he has used exactly
the same test for redudancy that the original objector,
Baker 1770, did: he defines because as "for the reason
that" (Baker used "by Reason") and finds it redundant
with the earlier reason in the sentence. Baker did not
apply the term redundant; he merely said, "This Expression does not make Sense."
Any lexicographer can see the fault in that argument
at once: because has been defined in such a way as to
guarantee that it will be redundant or not make sense.
Unless people actually write sentences like "The reason
he failed is for the reason that..."—and in general they
do not—there is no reason to assume that because has
the meaning the critics assign it. Lexicographers have to
define words in situ, not in the abstract, removed from
context, and they know how easy it is to make hash of
any sentence by deciding beforehand that a word in it
means something other than what the author intended.
If, instead, you grant that because can have the meaning
"the fact that" or simply be equivalent to the conjunction that, the phrase the reason is because makes quite
clear sense and is not redundant.
So we conclude that there is no sufficient basis for
either the 18th-century or the 20th-century objection.
But there still remains a question of the kind of writing
in which the construction is used. Is it relatively rare in
literary use and found primarily in dialectal use or in the
speech of the uneducated? We think these examples will
answer:
The Reason was, because the Religion of the
Heathen, consisted rather in Rites and Ceremonies
—Francis Bacon, Essays, 1625
. . . but Gad, the strongest reason is because I can't
help it —John Dryden, Marriage à-la-Mode, 1673
We may call them the weaker sex, but I think the
true reason is because our Follies are stronger and
our faults more prevailing —William Congreve,
"Concerning Humour in Comedy," 1695
The reason I tell you so is, because it was done by
your parson —Jonathan Swift, Journal to Stella, 14
May 1711

The reason is because it is of more importance .. .
that innocence should be protected than it is that
guilt should be punished —John Adams, final argument in defense of the British soldiers involved in
the Boston Massacre, 1770
And the reason is, because language is not made
either by Grammarians or Philosophers —Thomas
Reid, Essays on the Intellectual Power of Man, 1785
(in Tucker 1967)
If the fellow who wrote it seems to know more of my
goings and comings than he could without complicity of mine, the reason is because he is a lovely old

The reason every one now tries to avoid it, to deny
that it is important, to make it seem vain to try to
do it, is because it is so difficult —Ernest Hemingway, Green Hills of Africa, 1935
One of the reasons so many found it difficult to
understand Billy Mitchell was because the man was

John Wain, American Scholar, Summer 1986
Except for Adams, these examples are all from written
sources, a good many of them literary, with some letters
and journals. The Dryden example was spoken by one
of the heroes in the play. The phrase existed in 17thcentury speech, and it exists in 20th-century speech:
. . . I think the reason anyone writes is because it's
fun —William Faulkner, 30 May 1957, in Faulkner
in the University, 1959
You may have noticed that in the 20th-century examples, reason is often separated from the because clause
by intervening matter, sometimes quite long. In the
older examples reason is more frequently found right
next to is because.
Reason and because art sometimes found in constructions where they are linked by than:
. . . upon no wiser a Reason than because it is wondrous Dark —Jonathan Swift, A Tale of A Tub, 1710
I didnt want to be the one to direct you to the Gum
Gatherer; but it is a favorite of mine if for no other
reason than because it is the only poem that I know
of that has found a way to speak poetically of chewing gum —Robert Frost, letter, 19 Feb. 1919
Occasionally, I write out what I have said in verse,
and generally for no better reason than because I
remember that I have written no verse for a long
time —The Autobiography of William Butler Yeats,
1953
. . . for no other reason than because he's a tenor
singer! —Ring Lardner, How to Write Short Stories,
1924
In this construction, too, because introduces a noun
clause.
No treatment of the reason is because would be complete without mention of the doubly "redundant" the
reason why is because (see also REASON WHY). It is more
common in older sources (it seems to have been a favorite construction of Swift's) than newer ones but is certainly not yet extinct:
. . . the true reason why the country gentlemen are
for a land-tax, and against a general excise, is,
because they are fearful that if the latter be granted,
they shall never get it down again —Samuel Pepys,
diary, 5 Nov. 1666
And the reason why we are often louder than the
players is, because we think we speak more wit —
William Wycherly, The Country Wife, 1675
Now, the Reason why those Antient Writers treated
this Subject only by Types and Figures, was, because
they durst not make open Attacks —Jonathan Swift,
A Tale of A Tub, 1710
And perhaps the reason why common Criticks are
inclin'd to prefer a judicious and methodical Genius
to a great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves.... —Alexander Pope, preface to
translation of the Iliad, Book III, 1715
He saw that the reason why witchcraft was ridiculed
was, because it was a phase of the miraculous —W.
E. H. Lecky, History of Rationalism in Europe, 1865
(in Hodgson 1889)
The reason why all we novelists .. . are abandoning
novels and taking to writing motion-picture scenarii
is because the latter are so infinitely the more simple
—P. G. Wodehouse, Something Fresh, 1915
. . . one of the reasons why I am not particularly well
read today is because I have spent so large a part of
the last twenty years rereading Dickens and Jane
Austen —Alexander Woollcott, letter, 15 Mar. 1932
The reason why his conclusion concerning Frege's
argument seemed plausible at the time was because
his propositional constituents are entities rather than
the names of those entities —Ronald J. Butler, Philosophical Rev., July 1954
. . . he clung to the literal truth of every word of the
Bible, to the extent of believing that the reason why
the Mastodons had become extinct... was because
they were too big to get into the Ark —Times Literary Supp., 19 Sept. 1968
Practically everything that we have shown you so far
is from writing, although there are three instances of fictitious speech (Dryden, Wycherly, Addison) and three
of real speech (Adams, Faulkner, and Hemingway, who
is quoting himself being interviewed). Bryant 1962
reports several studies showing the reason is that—the
form prescribed by teachers of composition—occurs in
edited prose about twice as often as the reason is
because; the same studies show the proportion approximately reversed in speech. We have good evidence of
the latter's currency in speech. In 1986 and 1987 we
have recorded it from a counsel at the Iran-Contra hearings, a local newscaster, television actor Edward Woodward, and such sports figures as Lee Trevino, Henry
Aaron, Jim Palmer, and Billy Martin. To these we can
add the colleague who remarked of a newspaper story,
"The reason she has a Mercedes is because her husband
is an orthopedic surgeon."
A few points made earlier in passing should be underlined. You will note, as Bryant did also, that the reason
is because occurs more often than not with words intervening between reason and is because, especially in the
20th-century evidence. You will also note that the evidence is heavily literary; the reason is because is not a
locution avoided by writers. We suspect, however, that
its use is often a matter of habit. We have multiple
examples from Francis Bacon, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Woollcott, Ernest Hemingway, and Groucho
Marx—not bad company for a writer.
In conclusion, the locution the reason is because has
been attested in literary use for about three and a half
centuries. It has been the subject of denigration for more
than two centuries. Both the literary use and the disapproval will doubtless continue unabated. Reason and
because seem to go together, probably, as Bryant
remarks, because "the natural connective stressing the
idea of reason is because."
Our examination of the reasons for condemning the
locution shows that they have little foundation, though
reason why 802 receptive
this will not prevent their being repeated frequently by
teachers of composition and usage commentators still to
come. We are not advising you to use the reason is
because just because many well-known writers have
used it. If it is not your natural idiom, there is no reason
for you to cultivate it. But if it is your natural idiom and
you choose to continue with it, you will surely be in
some very distinguished company.
reason why Reason why is denounced as a redundancy by American Heritage 1969, 1982, Shaw 1970,
1975, 1987, and Prentice Hall 1978; it is defended by
Evans 1957 and Bernstein 1971. Bernstein, in fact, finds
instances when the why is required, and says that even
when it is not required, it is never unidiomatic or
wrong. Most other commentators who mention it are
tolerant. Their tolerance is well taken, for many usage
writers themselves use reason why. We have examples
from Lounsbury 1908, Fowler 1926, Gowers 1948,
Evans 1957, Phythian 1979, Johnson 1982, and Howard
1984.
The question of the propriety of reason why is an
American one that originated in this century. We do not
know who started it. Vizetelly 1906 mentions it, but
only as an idiom; he later called it correct in a 1929 issue
of the Literary Digest. Leonard included it on his 1932
survey of usage, where it was considered established, as
it was again in Crisp's 1971 survey.
A contemporary author responding to Crisp's survey
blamed the expression on Tennyson because of his line
"Theirs not to reason why...." A couple of commentators—Simon 1980 and Harper 1975, 1985—also give
Tennyson some credit for propagating the phrase. But
Tennyson—who used the verb reason, not the noun—
could not have had more than a slight reinforcing effect:
the locution dates back to 1225 and was well established
long before Tennyson's time.
The reason why a Poet is said, that hee ought to have
all knowledges, is that... —Ben Jonson, Timber: or,
Discoveries, before 1637

receipt, recipe The status of receipt as a synonym of
recipe has been the cause of some uneasiness and confusion for decades:
A perplexed correspondent asked Emily Post why it
was that she used the word "receipt" instead of "recipe" in discussing cookery. Mrs. Post replied that
"receipt" is a word of fashionable descent, used in
this sense, so she preferred it to the more commercial
"recipe" —Mrs. J. N. Cornelius, Birmingham (Ala.)
News, 30 July 1937
A look in the OED doesn't give much support to the
"fashionable" and "commercial" distinction made by
Emily Post, but it does show that both receipt and recipe
have been used in their synonymous sense for many
centuries. Both words originally had to do with medicinal preparations rather than with food. Receipt is the
older word, having as its first recorded use an occurrence in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (ca. 1386). Recipe
was first recorded as a noun in the 1500s. Both words
had begun to be applied to cookery by about the middle
of the 18th century. Thereafter recipe gradually took
precedence over receipt, and it has long since established
itself as the almost invariable word of choice. Receipt is
now most familiar in the sense "a writing acknowledging the receiving of goods or money," a meaning that it
has had since the 17th century. Its use as a synonym of
recipe does still occur, and it is not incorrect, but it has
a strongly old-fashioned quality, and its appearance in
writing seems now almost always meant to evoke the
past:
. . . boiled cider applesauce, straight out of Grammie
Bowles' blue receipt file —Holiday, November 1973
. . . so she could follow a century-old Vermont
"receipt" that called for cooking the whole fruit until
it was tangy —Evan Jones, N.Y. Times, 6 Jan. 1982
receptive When used with a preposition, receptive is
now almost always followed by to:
Now more than ever publishers will be forced to be
receptive to bestseller books —James T. Farrell, in
New Directions, 1946
. . . he is just as receptive to constructive criticism as
he is ready to give it —Chris Albertson, Saturday
Rev., 27 Nov. 1971
recipe 803
reckon
. . . Pasternak had been mildly receptive to the revolution —Irving Howe, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 5
Feb. 1978
At one time receptive was quite commonly found with
of; the OED quotes both Defoe and Coleridge, among
other authors, for the use. Receptive of seems to have
receded in contemporary writing, although it was not
rare in the first half of the 20th century:
Robinson was, like the Wells he goes out of his way
so often to praise, almost too receptive of new ideas
—Saturday Rev., 9 Jan. 1937
. . . expanding one's personality that it may become
receptive of that inexplicable energy which guarantees personal power —Lloyd C. Douglas, Doctor
Hudson's Secret Journal, 1939
Infrequently, receptive has been used with for:
... increase tension of the ear drum, making it more
receptive for light sounds —Saturday Rev., 9 Jan.
1937
recipe See RECEIPT, RECIPE.
recipient Fowler 1926 scornfully cites several
instances of inflated journalistic prose in which someone is said to have been "the recipient of a presentation" or "the recipient of congratulations." Such selfconscious formality is perhaps less popular among journalists than it once was; we, at least, have collected no
further evidence of recipient used in such a stiffly unnatural way. Its most familiar use in current English is to
denote a person to whom something desirable, such as
an award or a diploma, has been formally presented:
. . . is also the recipient of two honorary degrees —
Current Biography, January 1967
. . . would an Englishman rather be the recipient of
the Victoria Cross or .. . —Herbert R. Mayes, Saturday Rev., 4 Dec. 1971
The formality of the word is appropriate in these
contexts.
reckon 1. When used with a preposition, reckon is
most often followed by with, the phrase constituting an
idiom meaning "to take into consideration":
. . . a brilliant book that will have to be reckoned
with by all informed students of American society —
Richard Hofstadter, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 27 Feb.
1955
. . . have found Mormonism so fascinating or so provocative that they have been unable to resist the urge
to reckon with it in print —Fawn Brodie, Frontier,
December 1952
The assertion that man was always a killer .. . must
reckon with these many alternative possibilities —
Lewis Mumford, American Scholar, Winter 1966-67
. . . the Communists were still a force to be reckoned
with —Robert Shaplen, New Yorker, 24 Apr. 1971
Although reckon is also followed by without, meaning
"to fail to consider," this usage is not nearly so prevalent
as is reckon with:
But the Georgia legislature had reckoned without the
speculators and their friends —Sidney Warren, Current History, February 1952
Miss Hope reckoned without the genius of Feuer and
Martin—Henry Hewes, Saturday Rev., 16 Oct. 1954
Reckon is sometimes used with on:
The King scarcely knew on what members of his
own cabinet he could reckon —T. B. Macaulay, The
History of England, vol. I, 1849
. . . a man of our own times and once again in the
generations a man and a poet to reckon on —
Edward Townsend Booth, Saturday Rev., 4 Oct.
1947
Occasionally reckon is followed by among, as, at, by, in,
or upon:
. . . he must be reckoned among the great mathematicians of our time —Times Literary Supp., 21 May
1970
I pass to another field where the dominance of the
method of sociology may be reckoned as assured —
Selected Writings of Benjamin N. Cardozo, ed. Margaret E. Hall, 1947
These assets were reckoned at $ 1,250,000 —Marquis
James, The Texaco Story, 1953
. . . each cutter's share .. . was reckoned only by the
number of days he had worked —Joel Aronoff, Psychology Today, January 1971
. . . RCA's productivity as reckoned in sales per

RCA, 1977
There are many things in which I think I shall be
wiser if I come back, but do not reckon upon it —
The Letters of Rachel Henning, Written between
1853 and 1882, 1952
In American English, reckon may be found with to, but
only infrequently. In British English, reckon followed by
to and the infinitive is quite common:
. .. despite his astonishing anticipations of the painting of the end of the nineteenth century, it seems better to reckon him to the old school —Frank Jewett
Mather, Jr., Modern Painting, 1927
. . . up till then it had not reckoned to accept papers
of living authors, even as gifts —Philip Larkin,
Required Writing, 1983
. .. with gold in the $ 170 range, it is reckoned to be
worthwhile having a look at the gold prospects —
Leslie Parker, Financial Times (London), 17 Apr.
1974
. . . he reckons to spend about a year on a book —
Anna Pavord, Observer Mag., 14 Apr. 1974
In both American and British English, reckon is often
followed by a clause:
"I reckon it would scare Senator Johns half to
death...." —John Dos Passos, Number One, 1943
".. . As for finishing the job, I reckon we'll all be
there together...." —Richard Llewellyn, A Few
Flowers for Shiner, 1950
He doubtless reckoned, as almost everyone here
reckons, that it was a mite better to uphold the courts
—Richard H. Rovere, New Yorker, 5 Oct. 1957
recollect 804 recrudescence
We reckon that we have been hired to get results —
The Bookseller, 18 May 1974
2. "Reckon" in the sense of "suppose, think":
. . . so I reckon Bernage is on very good foot when he
goes to Spain —Jonathan Swift, Journal to Stella, 12
Feb. 1711
Howard 1977 notes this use of reckon as one of several
standard 18th-century usages that survive in common
use in British English but have dropped out of standard
American use. Some examples from British English:
Our brickies reckon the house that Jack built in
England would go up faster here —8 O'Clock (Auckland, N.Z.), 8 Feb. 1975
"If you reckon that paradise is a hamburger...." —
William Nagle, Nation Rev. (Melbourne), 1 May
1975
. . . I reckon they pinched the money —John Fowles,
The Collector, 1963
We used to reckon it upped a man's sex appeal at
least 20 per cent —advt., Sunday Times Mag. (London), 7 Apr. 1974
Russia is one place Americans reckon they are
unlikely to be victims of a terrorist attack —The
Economist, 26 Apr. 1986
In American English this use is mostly dialectal; it
may occasionally be used in informal or deliberately
countrified contexts:
And I bought this one for $4.75. I was, oh I reckon,
ten years old —William Faulkner, 7 Mar. 1957, in
Faulkner in the University, 1959
I reckon I grew up under Roosevelt —Representative Claude Pepper, quoted in People, 21 June 1982
I reckon he doesn't like to feel surrounded by
females —Flannery O'Connor, letter, 20 Sept. 1951
. . . we fairly reckoned you'd be with us on one of the
weekends —John O'Hara, letter, March 1931
I reckon if anybody wears a double-breasted suit
properly it's Doug Fairbanks —G. Bruce Boyer,
Town & Country, March 1983
More Americans would use / guess where these people
use / reckon.
recollect, remember The distinction that can be
made between these words is that recollect implies—or
can imply—a conscious effort to recall something to the
mind ("He tried to recollect the name of the street"),
while remember more generally implies only having
something available in one's memory ("He always
remembered what she had said"). This distinction has
been noted in dictionaries at least since Webster 1828,
and in books on usage at least since Richard Grant
White 1870. White regarded the use of recollect without
connotations of conscious effort as an error, and a number of subsequent commentators (such as Vizetelly
1906, Bierce 1909, Fowler 1926, and Evans 1957) have
more or less agreed with him. But the evidence shows
that the distinction is not really a strong one. The "conscious effort" connotations of recollect certainly exist,
and they come across clearly in some contexts:
".. . tried to recollect how you looked, but I have
never been able to recall a single feature." —Douglas
Southall Freeman, "General Lee at the Surrender,"
in Worlds of Adventure (textbook), ed. Matilda Bailey & Ullin Whitney Leavell, 1951
But for many writers the real distinguishing characteristic of recollect seems to be that it has a folksy quality
suggestive of rustic speech:
"I don't recollect ever hearing anything foolish about
Rebekah ... " —Ellen Glasgow, Barren Ground,
1925
I don't recollect ever once hearing any man of my
family swear ... , so of course it didn't come natural
to me —Gerald Warner Brace, The Garretson
Chronicle, 1947
And recollect also occurs in contexts where it seems to
be little more than a straightforward synonym of
remember:
Thank you for recollecting my weakness —Emily
Dickinson, letter, 1869
. . . I recollect very clearly that one day when I was
out sailing it snowed —Frances H. Eliot, New
England Journeys, 1953
In short, recollect has distinct shades of meaning that
are apparent in some but not all of its uses. It is, fundamentally, a synonym of remember, and its use without connotations of conscious effort is not an error.
reconcile Two prepositions are idiomatic after reconcile—with and to:
. . . to reconcile technology with human cussedness
—Russell Lynes, Harper's, October 1968
. . . how could one reconcile this arrogant separatism
with the goals of integration? —David Loye, Psychology Today, May 1971
. . . it temporarily reconciles us to that condition —
Clifton Fadiman, Center Mag, January/February
1971
Nothing can reconcile Nader to the time lag —
Charles McCarry, Saturday Rev., 12 Feb. 1972
Only with is possible when reconcile is being used as an
intransitive verb:
. . . was estranged from her husband... but has since
reconciled with him —Springfield (Mass.) Union, 24
May 1968
recourse See RESOURCE.
recrudescence Recrudescence in its literal sense is a
medical word denoting a renewed outbreak of a disease:
. . . prompt use of penicillin in streptococcic pharyngitis .. . has eliminated recrudescences following
such infections—Therapeutic Notes, Feburary 1951
In extended use, recrudescence typically describes a
renewed occurrence or appearance of something
objectionable:
. . . the recrudescence of violent nationalism in any
European country —Walter Laqueur, Commentary,
January 1972
recur 805 redundancy
It has also sometimes been used as a neutral term simply equivalent to renewal or revival:
... dates from this recrudescence of the Italian theatre —Sacheverell Sitwell, The Dance of the Quick
and the Dead, 1936
. . . there has been a sharp recrudescence of interest
in the Rogers mystique —H. Allen Smith, Esquire,
May 1974
Such usage was first criticized in 1906 by the Fowler
brothers, who argued that recrudescence should only be
applied to the renewal of something unwelcome. H. W.
Fowler repeated the criticism more strongly in 1926,
and Eric Partridge noted and agreed with Fowler's opinion in 1942. Evans 1957, however, asserted that in
American usage recrudescence was applicable to any
renewed outbreak, "good or bad."
This issue is not an important one for most writers.
Recrudescence is a fairly uncommon word, and most
writers are unlikely to use it, either because they do not
know it themselves or because they suspect that many
of their readers will not know it. Our evidence suggests
that recrudescence was in somewhat more common use
during the first half of the century than it is now, and
most of our examples of the disputed use are from that
period. Those who now use the word in extended applications, according to our evidence, almost always use it
in ways that would be approved by the Fowlers and by
Partridge.
recur, recurrence, reoccur, reoccurrence Of these
two pairs, recur and recurrence are by far the more common. A couple of commentators criticize reoccur and
reoccurrence as unnecessary, but they are distinguishable in some ways from recur and recurrence. Reoccur
and reoccurrence are the more basic words: they simply
tell you that something happened again. Recur and especially recurrence can suggest a periodic or frequent repetition as well as the simpler notion.
Castillo was removed from the game after the third
because of a muscle pull on the right side of his neck.
Twins trainer Dick Martin said it was a reoccurrence
of a previous injury —Tom Yantz, Hartford (Conn.)
Courant, 20 May 1983
In this example, reoccurrence merely says that the muscle pull had happened before; if the trainer had used
recurrence, it could have suggested that the player had
had the same injury more than once before. This does
not quite mean, as one or two critics hold, that reoccurrence means one repetition only; it rather implies nothing about the number of repetitions, whereas recurrence
is likely to.
But such niceties aside, most writers make do with
recur and recurrence:
There was a recurrence of this after the cataract operation —James Thurber, letter, 18 Dec. 1950
. . . institutions specifically created to prevent a
recurrence of past fiscal problems —Felix G. Rohatyn, The Twenty-Year Century, 1983
. . . the motifs have become so numerous... that the
mind cannot hold them together. One can only enjoy
them as they occur and recur —George Stade, N. Y.
Times Book Rev., 17 June 1979
redolent According to Follett 1966, redolent with has
a bad odor. He calls it "almost as uncouth as smells with
would be." Bernstein 1965 says flatly that redolent takes
the preposition of. And so it does:
. . . are delightfully well-regulated, clean, orderly and
redolent of pleasure —Albert Goldman, New York,
24 July 1972
.. . the air was redolent of sawdust, paint, and coffee
—David Dorsey, New England Monthly, March
1988
But it also takes the preposition with, as a look in the
OED clearly shows. Redolent of is the older and more
common idiom, but redolent with has been in use since
the early 19th century and is certainly standard:
The Grand Being entered his magnificent palace,
redolent with fragrant perfumes —Henry Alabaster,
The Wheel of the Law, 1871 (OED)
. . . a London working-class shopping district .. .
redolent with fried fish shops —C. S. Forester, The
African Queen, 1935
. . . the atmosphere had been redolent with sympathies —Angus Wilson, Such Darling Dodos, 1950
. . . the image is redolent with keen, even if less than
original, irony —John Simon, New York, 18 Oct.
1976
redundancy Have you ever felt that when you were
talking to someone you were not being listened to? That
your message was being misunderstood, or only partially understood? We have all had that experience,
surely. It could be described as transmitting a message
over a noisy channel—the noise in this instance being
whatever it is in the mind of our listener that distracts
attention from what we are saying. It is analogous to the
problem of sending a message by radio or telephone
through a lot of static.
Every language, it seems, has built-in mechanisms for
helping the spoken message penetrate the noise. These
mechanisms are called redundancy, a sense of the term
perhaps borrowed from information science, the mathematical study of the transmission of electronic messages. A useful definition of redundancy can be found in
Todd& Hancock 1986:
In linguistics, it refers to data which may be unnecessary but which may help our understanding. In a
phrase such as:
those two dogs
plurality is marked three times. Most speech contains redundancies and so we often understand utterances even if we miss part of what was said.
This redundancy is something that helps a speaker or a
writer get a message across even when the hearer or
reader has missed part of it through inattention or distraction. This, then, is a useful redundancy; it protects
the message and it facilitates the reception of the information or the idea the speaker or writer is trying to
communicate.
Repetition, in one way or another, is the most
obvious form of useful redundancy; by repeating an idea
or a whole message, the writer or speaker can ensure
that the reader or hearer does not miss the point. But,
as the information scientists point out, a price must be
paid for this use of repetition. It is loss of transmission
speed. If everything in the message were to be repeated,
transmission speed would slow down to almost nothing.
If the speaker repeats and repeats, communication is
refer 806 refer
likely to be broken altogether; the hearer falls asleep or
walks away. If the writer repeats and repeats, the reader
closes the book.
This brings us to a second meaning of redundancy
that Todd & Hancock mentions: the use of too many
words, what we might call wordy redundancy. The
whole question of redundancy for writers comes down
to the identification of the fine line between useful
redundancy and wordy redundancy. This is seldom a
problem in conversation, unless you have the misfortune to be a long-winded bore, but it may be one for the
public speaker. It is also not a problem for usage writers,
almost all of whom fail to recognize that there is such a
thing as useful redundancy, even though they employ it
themselves.
Here are a number of examples of useful redundancy.
We will depart from the usual style of our examples and
italicize the redundancies. You will note that many of
them involve adverbs and prepositions. There are also
several examples with emphasizing adjectives.
These five passages have not been picked out
because they are especially bad.... I number them
so that I can refer back to them —George Orwell,
"Politics and the English Language," 1946
. . . to see if the waters were abated from off the face
of the ground —Genesis 8:8 (AV), 1611
And both return back to their chairs —Shakespeare,
Richard II, 1596
. . . would also revert back to Panama —Current
Biography, June 1968
concur .. . has three different meanings —Harper
1985
There is also the additional problem raised by the
casting .. . —John Simon, New York, 5 Apr. 1976
. . . are usually unnecessary padding in a sentence —
Little, Brown 1986
. . . marked for James the final end of his freedom —
K. M. Elisabeth Murray, Caught in the Web of
Words, 1977
. . . one's past history was going to be removed —
Norman Mailer, Harper's, March 1971
. . . the process of starting over again —Leacock
1943
. . . let us begin with a true and authentic story —W.
M. Thackeray, The Book of Snobs, 1846
. . . the unequal combat waged here nightly is
replayed again —Robert E. Taylor, Wall Street
Jour., 11 Sept. 1980
. . . it commands our attention so much that we are
never necessitated to repeat the same thing over a
second time—Adam Smith, lecture, 14 Jan. 1763, in
Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, éd. John M.
Lothian, 1971
None of these redundancies impedes the flow of information, not even the last and longest (taken from
speech, where longer redundancies are more useful than
they are in writing). They all belong to our first type of
redundancy—the useful—or if not positively useful, at
least harmless. It is interesting that the handbooks
quoted here (especially Harper 1985 and Little, Brown
1986) devote considerable space to the denunciation of
exactly these kinds of redundant combinations, as does
the book written by John Simon (Simon 1980). And
George Orwell, in the very article we have quoted, lays
it down as a rule that we should cut all unnecesssary
words out of our writing.
The notion that redundant words should be eliminated from writing goes back to the 18th century.
Lindley Murray 1795 put it this way:
The first rule for promoting the strength of a sentence, is, to prune it of all redundant words and
members.
Murray may have taken this rule from one of his
sources. It is not much different from Orwell's:
If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
But it had been recognized by writers as early as Ben
Jonson that too terse a style could be a fault, not a
virtue:
. . . the Language is thinne, flagging, poore, starv'd;
scarce covering the bone, and shewes like stones in a
sack. Some men to avoid Redundancy, runne into
that; and while they strive to have no ill blood, or
Juyce, they loose their good —Timber: or, Discoveries, before 1637
Some recent commentators too, such as Evans 1957 and
Bailey 1984, warn against being too concise.
To repeat, there are two kinds of redundancy—the
desirable kind of the linguist and the undesirable wordy
kind. Much that is written in usage books about redundancy mistakes the first for the second. The usual pronouncements about refer back, final result, collaborate
together, continue on, end result, past history, general
consensus, personal friend, off of and many, many more
should therefore be taken with a large grain of salt. This
is not to say that you must use the redundant forms, but
you should feel free to judge for yourself where they may
be useful to communication or may simply sound better
than the shorter alternatives. Remember that the sound
and rhythm of a sentence are important in transmitting
your message through the noise:
. . . inside a sentence the mere sound, the mere number of syllables used, is sometimes more important
than the bare meaning of the words. In writing, as in
conversation, an economical use of words is not
always what we want —Evans 1957
See also WORDINESS.
refer This verb is often used with back:
... "Death in Venice" also refers back to Britten's
earlier operas on nearly every page —Peter G. Davis,
N.Y. Times, 13 Oct. 1974
Such usage has been the object of criticism at least since
Krapp 1927 described it as "a crude pleonasm for refer.'"
Among recent commentators who have cited refer back
for redundancy are Shaw 1975, Harper 1975, 1985, and
Copperud 1980. Bernstein 1971, on the other hand,
pooh-poohs such criticism, asserting that "The notion
of back is not at all prominent or even necessarily present in the word refer, which has as its primary meaning
to direct attention to." We think that Bernstein makes a
good point. Back may seldom be necessary with refer,
but the "backward" connotations of refer are usually
référendums 807 regard
not strong, and back can be useful in reinforcing
them:
Professor Dulles .. . has throughout referred back to
the original sources —Owen Lattimore, N. Y. Herald
Tribune Book Rev., 2 June 1946
They do not refer back to models in the reality we
know —John W. Aldridge, After the Lost Generation, 1951
I number them so that I can refer back to them when
necessary —George Orwell, "Politics and the
English Language," 1946
I have to be careful with my own research. I put it
down in black and white. People can refer back to it
—John D. MacDonald, TV Guide, 24 Nov. 1979
If you tend to be especially sensitive to redundancy in
writing, you may want to avoid refer back in your own.
Many good writers find it useful, however.
référendums, referenda These two plurals are about
equally represented in our files for the past thirty years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, référendums was somewhat
more common; in the 1980s referenda has a slight lead.
Copperud 1980 thinks that referenda sounds affected,
but there is nothing in our evidence to suggest that anyone else does.
No one seems to have any difficulty in recognizing referenda as a plural. For a list of foreign plurals which are
sometimes used as singulars, see LATIN PLURALS.
reflexive pronouns For a discussion of the use of
reflexive pronouns in place of nominative and especially objective forms, see MYSELF. See also HISSELF;
THEIRSELVES; THEMSELF; YOURSELF, YOURSELVES.
refute Refute has two senses, both of which are in
common use, but one of which is widely regarded as an
error. Its original and uncontroversial sense is "to prove
wrong; show to be false or erroneous":
It is not necessary to refute such an argument point
by point —Denis Goulet, Center Mag., May 1969
. . . his superior book .. . appears to refute that contention —New Yorker, 2 Oct. 1971
Its disputed sense is "to deny the truth or accuracy of:
We refute these aspersions whether they come from
our best friends or our worst foes —Sir Winston
Churchill, address in House of Commons, 18 Jan.
1945, in Voices of History 1945-46, ed. Nathan
Ausubel, 1946
Prime Minister Michael Manley .. . yesterday again
refuted allegations that Jamaica House interfered —
Jamaica Weekly Gleaner, 13 Feb. 1974
This sense seems to have originated in the 20th century.
Its common use has become apparent only in the past
several decades, but criticism of it dates back as far as
Utter 1916. Most usage commentators now routinely
take note of it, and all that do consider it a mistake (the
British, in particular, seem to feel strongly on this subject). It is, however, extremely common, and the contexts in which it occurs are standard. Its most frequent
use is by journalists in reporting the emphatic denials
issued by those accused of wrongdoing. Hardly a day
now goes by, it seems, without one government official
or another refuting a new set of allegations.
regard 1. In regard to, with regard to, as regards,
regarding. There is a mixed bag of opinion about these,
in which we can discern two main lines of commentary.
The first of these apparently began with Quiller-Couch
1916, who condemned as regards and with regard to as
circumlocutory and jargonistic. Many modern handbooks, especially the college variety, express a similar
judgment, often extending it to in regard to and regarding as well. The critics prefer such alternatives as about,
on, and concerning, and in many contexts you will no
doubt find them preferable yourself. But remember that
the matter of wordiness is entirely secondary to the matter of how your sentence sounds. When longer phrases
suit the rhythm of a sentence better than short ones, the
longer ones are a better choice.
The second line of comment goes back at least as far
as MacCracken & Sandison 1917, where in regards to
used in place of in regard to is cited as an error. The
adherents to this line are also numerous, but they are
almost all American (the one exception is Longman
1988). The issue in this case appears to be largely a
social one. In regards to seems to be an expression heard
chiefly from those who speak H. L. Mencken's
"vulgate."
Most of our citations were taken from phone-in radio
programs. We also have found it in a letter written to us
and once in print by this noted practitioner of the
vulgate:
. . . maybe boys and gals who wants to take up writing as their life work would be benefited if some person like I was to give them a few hints in regards to
the technic of the short story —Ring Lardner, preface, How to Write Short Stories, 1924
Our evidence suggests that in regards to is an oral use
not found in edited prose.
In regard to, with regard to, as regards, and regarding,
on the other hand, are all perfectly standard. Here are a
few examples of the words at work:
In regard to the work of an already famous or infamous author it decides .. . —Edgar Allan Poe, The
Literati, 1850
. . . conclusions I had reached with regard to Vietnam —Tip O'Neill with William Novak, Man of the
House, 1987
. . . adviser to Douglas of Cavers with regard to the
annual distribution of alms —K. M. Elisabeth Murray, Caught in the Web of Words, 1977
Indeed the similarity .. . is extraordinary, as regards
the military methods of both sides —G. M. Trevelyan, A Shortened History of England, 1942
As regards function, these centuries are those in
which the ancient patterns of cumulative negation
appear in the standard language —Strang 1970
Regarding the four types of heart diseases .. . , the
president of ABC said .. . —Winston Munnings,
Nassau (Bahamas) Guardian, 3 Mar. 1984
Miss Crawley was pleased at the notion of a gossip
with her sister-in-law regarding the late Lady Crawley —W. M. Thackeray, Vanity Fair, 1848
2. A curious issue concerns the omission of as after
regard in constructions where as would normally be
expected ("was regarded a traitor" rather than "was
regarded as a traitor"). This subject has troubled British
regret 808 reign
commentators from Fowler 1907 to Longman 1988. It
has penetrated one or two American books, perhaps
because of its lengthy treatment by Fowler. The problem
is this: regard is generally associated with verbs that take
a direct object and a second complement introduced by
a particle: regard (object) as, describe (object) as, take
(object) for, look upon (object) as, and so forth. Since
some time in the 19th century (the OED's earliest example is from 1836), regard has been showing some movement in the direction of ditransitive verbs like think,
which take an object and a complement with no intervening particle. Consider, the verb prescribed by Fowler
to replace regard in his numerous examples, is more
strongly linked with the ditransitives (though it is also
used with as like regard, a usage decried by some American commentators).
The fact that Fowler 1926 has more than twice as
many examples as Fowler 1907 suggests that the ditransitive regard had a burst of popularity around the turn
of the century, which continued right up to 1926. As late
as 1968 the grammarian Randolph Quirk (quoted in
Strang 1970) said that the ditransitive regardwas "readily attested in everyday examples of speech and writing
as well as in the vociferous complaints of purists." But,
curiously enough, Quirk et al. 1985 calls as with regard
obligatory and makes no mention of ditransitive regard
at all. It hardly seems possible that the construction disappeared completely between 1968 and 1985.
All of this British controversy is a bit puzzling to the
American, as Copperud 1980 attests. The constructions
that so exercised Fowler are rare in our files. Fowler's
first objection was to regard with a complement introduced by an infinitive rather than as:
"You perceive that even if this Jehovah is not God
he is nevertheless regarded to be in the enjoyment of
considerable powers " —Henry Baerlein, The
House of the Fighting-Cocks, 1880
That is our only example. Of the ditransitive regard we
have a genuine American example (in the passive):
. . . treated in a manner calculated to make him feel
that he is regarded a sinister figure —George F. Kennan, New Republic, 2 Feb. 1953
But this, too, is our only one. Either our editors have
been missing this construction for the past half century,
or it is relatively rare in American English.
We do not have any current British evidence, either,
so we are not sure whether British use of the ditransitive
regard has dwindled. The silence of Quirk et al. 1985
might suggest that, but the notices in Longman 1984
and Longman 1988 suggest that it is still in use.
Objections to the use of as after otherwise ditransitive
verbs receive some attention at AS 5 and at CONSIDER 1.
regret When a preposition follows the noun regret,
the usual choice is for:
. . . his bitter regrets for past happiness —T. S. Eliot,
"Shakespeare and the Stoicism of Seneca," in
Selected Essays, 1932
. . . regrets for past mistakes —Times Literary Supp.,
29 Apr. 1955
Note that in the Eliot citation "regrets for" means something like "regretful longings for," whereas in the second
citation it means simply "regretful feelings for." The
second citation illustrates the more common usage.
Other prepositions that may occur after regret are at and
over, neither of which would be idiomatic with the
"regretful longings" sense, but both of which are possible with the "regretful feelings" sense.
regretful, regrettable, regretfully, regrettably
Fowler 1926 was the first to observe that regretful is
sometimes confused with regrettable. Many later commentators have also felt the need to explain the distinction between these words, although the emphasis in
recent years has shifted more to the use of the adverbs,
regretfully and regrettably. Fowler cited three passages,
apparently gleaned from newspapers, in which regretful
was used to mean "causing regret" (which is the meaning of regrettable) rather than "feeling or showing
regret." Strangely enough, we have no further evidence
of regretful used in this way from any other source,
including other usage writers, the OED, and our own
citation files. If this use of regretful still occurs, it is
apparently quite rare. The adverb regretfully, on the
other hand, is beginning to show a tendency to be used
as a synonym of regrettably, meaning "to a regrettable
extent" or "in a manner that causes regret." Our first
evidence of this use is from the mid-1960s, which is also
when it was first criticized (by Flesch 1964 and Bernstein 1965). It is possible that this use owes something
to the similar use of hopefully (which see), which underwent a boom in popularity a few years earlier. Regretfully has never approached hopefully in frequency of
use, however. We have only a handful of citations for
the disputed sense of regretfully, including the following:
. . . seems to have been their last, and regretfully lost,
chance to talk with Jenny —Mabel F. Hale, NewEngland Galaxy, Winter 1965
. . . its regretfully pronounced tendency to obliterate
distinctions —Maurice Friedberg, Saturday Rev., 10
Jan. 1970
. . . we regretfully overlooked an announcement —
Mort Reed, Springfield (Mass.) Union, 5 Aug. 1972
Regretfully, that is no grounds for leniency towards
him — New Statesman, 20 Aug. 1976 (OED
Supplement)
Regrettably is still much the more common choice in
such contexts:
. . . and shows, regrettably, that he is still under their
influence —John Kenneth Galbraith, Saturday Rev.,
6 Nov. 1971
None of my uncles, regrettably, was French —S. J.
Perelman, N. Y. Times Mag, 15 Jan. 1978
. .. which I regrettably missed —Simon 1980
Note that regrettably functions in these passages as a
sentence modifier (see SENTENCE ADVERB), more or less
equivalent to "I regret to say." Regretfully in the passage
from New Statesman functions in the same way.
reign, rein The triumph of the automobile is revealed
in our loss of awareness of words associated with the
horse. Rein is a case in point. Once an everyday household word, it has been driven into relative obscurity by
the automobile. Horse-lovers still know and use it, of
course, as do jockeys and enthusiasts of horse racing and
dressage. Several idiomatic expressions with rein continue in general use, but since the word is not nearly as
common as it once was, writers and keyboarders tend to
confuse it with its homophone reign. Copperud 1980
reiterate 809 relation
takes note of in full reign and turn over the reigns. Our
files have free reign from Harper's Bazaar in 1981 and
People in 1987, and takes the reigns from TV Guide in
1986. If you are not sure whether you want rein or reign,
your dictionary will help you.
reiterate This verb has attracted commentary
because it has a kind of built-in redundancy; there is a
rarely used verb iterate (from the Latin iterum, "again")
that itself means "to say or do again," so that it seems
as if reiterate ought to mean something like "to re-say
or re-do again," or "to say or do over and over." Bernstein 1962 disapproves its use in describing a first repetition (he favors repeat or restate), and Einstein 1985
agrees:
If you've said something once and you now say it
again, you aren't reiterating. You're iterating. From
the third time on, you're reiterating.
But other commentators (such as Harper 1975, 1985
and Bryson 1984) recognize that no such nice distinction exists in actual usage. Both iterate and reiterate are
used essentially as synonyms of repeat, with the chief
distinction between them being that reiterate is the far
more common word. Reiterate does, however, often
convey the idea of many repetitions:
. . . by echoing the point... Mr. Kaminsky had frequently reiterated with gallows humor —Judith
Appelbaum, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 12 Dec. 1982
. . . and repeatedly reiterates his views that the
Supreme Court's .. . decision was wrong —David
Farrell, Boston Globe, 22 July 1984
. . . even such genuine affection grows numbing
when reiterated more than 600 times —Geoffrey C.
Ward, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 7 Aug. 1983
But it frequently has no such connotations. Very often,
it is instead distinguished from such common verbs as
repeat and restate by connotations of forcefulness and
emphasis:
. . . he reiterated his anti-war views even more forcefully —Dictionary of American Biography, 1936
In his speech of acceptance Wilson reiterated his
belief in "aggressive Americanism, international
realism, and no compromise with communism." —
Current Biography 1953
This, I reiterate, might have happened —George F.
Kennan, New Yorker, 1 May 1971
To reiterate: a catch phrase is something to be both
admired .. . and avoided —Simon 1980
Iterate, on the other hand, is rarely used except in mathematical and technical writing:
. . . the functions obtained by iterating the operation
of differentiation —School Mathematics Study
Group, Calculus, Parti, 1965
Outside of such contexts, it is a decidedly bookish word:
This ancient motif .. . was classically iterated by
Horace and later, in the last gasp of a noble and epicurean Roman culture, by Ausonius —J. O. Tate,
National Rev., 15 Nov. 1985
rejoice The next time something makes you feel like
rejoicing, feel free to rejoice either in it or at it. In is the
more common choice, but at is also idiomatic and far
from rare:
We do not, I suspect, rejoice in force more than other
nations —Stringfellow Barr, Center Mag., May 1968
. . . the young people who rejoice in such language —
Franklin L. Ford, Harvard Today, Autumn 1968
A layman can only rejoice at the legal subtlety and
boldness —Robert Lekachman, New Republic, 29
Nov. 1954
Rejoice in is sometimes used to mean simply "have or
possess":
One of the characters .. . rejoices in the name of
Sherlock Feldman —Bennett Cerf, Saturday Rev., 22
May 1954
The higher parts of the mountains rejoice in an average annual rainfall of thirty inches —Oliver La
Farge, N.Y. Times Mag., 15 Aug. 1954
Another preposition that occasionally occurs after
rejoice is over:
I wish you to rejoice with me over the consummation of this great gift —Ira Remsen, quoted in Johns
Hopkins Mag., April 1966
relate The sense of intransitive relate that means "to
have or establish a relationship, interact" seems to have
had its origins in the jargon or shoptalk of psychology
and sociology. It established itself in general use during
the 1960s as something of a vogue word. It has received
unflattering notice in Strunk & White 1972, 1979, Perrin
& Ebbitt 1972, Ebbitt & Ebbitt 1982, Bremner 1985, and
Harper 1975, 1985. A few of these find it a tad more
tolerable when relate is followed by a to phrase. It occurs
both without and with such a phrase:
. . . she herself had been the kind of child to grow up
incapable of relating: insecure, cold, undeveloped,
guilt-ridden —Margaret Drabble, The Needle's Eye,
1972
"They (teen-age salespeople) know what you want
and they can relate," says Karen Rascon as she
thumbs through Contempo's racks —Bonnie Gangelhoff, Houston Post, 2 Sept. 1984
"You can't just come in off the street and make
them," Mr. [Bob] Raspanti said emphatically. "You
have to understand the dough in order to relate to
it." —New Yorker, 4 Oct. 1982
I really don't relate to football like I do baseball —
Joe Falls, Sporting News, 25 Oct. 1982
In this last example relate means roughly "respond
favorably," a sense that has grown out of the popularized psychological one. The commentators—and you—
may find these uses a bit tiresome, but they clearly are
established in speech and in general writing.
relation 1 . Relation, relative. It is not exactly clear
why these words are to be found in so many usage books
when almost the only useful things to be said about
them are that they are synonymous in the sense "a person to whom one is related" and that they are frequently
plural in that sense. But in the books they are, and have
been, from Vizetelly 1906, Utter 1916, MacCracken &
Sandison 1917, and Fowler 1926, right down to Harper
relative 810
relatively
1985, Chambers 1985, Shaw 1987, and Longman 1988.
The commentators have tended to disagree in minor
ways about which is preferable. Evans 1957 and Bernstein 1962 believe relation to be rustic or bucolic; Simon
1980, however, thinks relation is U (for "upper-crust");
Fowler 1926, 1965 says relation is more common, but
Copperud 1970, 1980 and Shaw say relative is more
common. Perhaps we should all join Chambers 1985
and "justifiably conclude that such distinctions as [the
critics] do discern are matters of personal whim.. .. "
One thing we can say with certainty is that both relation
and relative are in common current use:
I grew up in a house where the only regular guests
were my relations. On a certain day, enormous families of relatives would visit us —Richard Rodriguez,
in The Bedford Reader, ed. X. J. Kennedy & Dorothy M. Kennedy, 1985
2. Relation is usually used with of in the sense of "relative" and sometimes in other senses:
. . . a polar explorer and a relation of Butler's first
wife —Current Biography, September 1964
. . . she stood in the relation of a chaperone and
sponsor to Elfine —Stella Gibbons, Cold Comfort
Farm, 1932
But to is more common with most senses and with most
of the idiomatic expressions:
While his relations to women were self-serving —
Anatole Broyard, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 9 May 1982
He has expressed his views on Africa and its relation
to the rest of the world —Current Biography, March
1966
. . . bears no relation to what I'm saying —Stephen
Vizinczey, letter to the editor, Times Literary Supp.,
5 June 1969
Stanza two presents her mind and body in relation
to her soul —John T. Shawcross, Hartford Studies in
Literature, vol. 2, no. 1, 1969
. . . their comfortable and complacent lives bear little
relation to the ideology they proclaim —Times Literary Supp., 7 Mar. 1968
In other senses, with and between (occasionally among)
are used:
. . . their relation with their slaves rested on injustice
and violence —Eugene D. Genovese, N.Y. Times
Book Rev., 20 July 1986
Relations between the United States and Spain —
Current Biography, November 1965
. .. the cultivation of relations among people for the
improvement of society —Dale B. Harris, in Automation, Education, and Human Values, ed. W. W.
Brickman & S. Lehrer, 1966
3. Bernstein 1965, Harper 1985, and Shaw 1987 discuss
negative constructions with relation. They contend that
if, for example, you want to say that your friend Murgatroyd is not related to the famous Murgatroyd, you
should say that he or she is "no relation of the wellknown Murgatroyd" rather than "no relation to the
well-known M." This issue does not seem to come up
very often; in fact, the only example our files have seen
of the criticized construction in recent years is from a
1968 Winners & Sinners in which a writer for the New
York Times is corrected for having written "He was no
relation to Senator McCarthy...." Apparently this construction occurs more often in speech than in writing.
Of may be insisted on in such a context because it is
used in positive statements for this sense of relation, as
illustrated in section 2 above. But no relation to is idiomatic with other senses of relation, and is not misleading with this one.
relative See RELATION 1.
relatively Relatively has been subjected to the same
strictures as comparatively has been—namely, that it
should not be used to modify an adjective when no
comparison is stated or implied—and by essentially the
same commentators. The first to state the proposition
seems to have been Gowers 1948, who later added it to
Fowler 1965. It also appears in Bernstein 1958, 1965,
Evans 1957, Nickles 1974, Shaw 1975, Phythian 1979,
Bryson 1984, and Heritage 1982.
The definition of comparatively in the OED might
have given Gowers a basis for his assertion, even though
he would have had to narrow it considerably (see COMPARATIVELY 1), but the OED definition at relatively
makes no mention at all of comparisons, either stated
or implied. The OED examples show that the usage
Gowers dislikes has been established since the earliest
uses of the adverb to modify adjectives.
In current practice, both uses of relatively—without
an explicit comparison and with an explicit comparison—are common, and there is no valid reason for you
to bother yourself about which way you use the word.
Here are a few examples of both:
I had a talk with Armstrong, who was looking quite
spick and span in relatively new clothes —The Journals of Arnold Bennett, ed. Frank Swinnerton, 1954
It apparently made relatively slow progress at the
start, but after a couple of years it was in wide and
indeed almost general use —H. L. Mencken, The
American Language, Supplement I, 1945
. . . the springbuck, the blesbuck, and the black wildebeest, denizens of high, relatively bare, plateau
country —J. Stevenson-Hamilton, Wild Life in
South Africa, 1947
. . . grew up to be a tall blond youth—relatively
unspoiled in spite of his wealth —William Styron,
Lie Down in Darkness, 1951
An atomic problem is not absolutely insoluble A
problem is only relatively insoluble; insoluble with
given tools —W. W. Sawyer, Prelude to Mathematics, 1955
. . . these two features are amongst the relatively few
fundamental ones that distinguish our handling of
words and sentences from that of 1611 —W. F. Bolton, A Short History of Literary English, 1967
Yes, men were relatively fragile —Norman Mailer,
Harper's, March 1971
The relatively few American leaders who understood

Literary Supp., 15 Aug. 1980
relative pronouns See THAT; WHAT; WHICH; WHO,
WHOM; WHOSE.
relevant 1 . No one questions the use of relevant when
it is an attributive adjective or when as a predicate
adjective it is followed by a to phrase, as in this example:
It's simply that they are not relevant to my experience —James Baldwin, quoted in N. Y. Times Book
Rev., 27 May 1984
But sometime in the middle 1960s relevant, conspicuously used as a predicate adjective without a prepositional phrase, came to be rather a vogue word, especially
among college students. What was happening was not so
much the development of a new construction as the
development of a new meaning much used in that construction. Here we have some examples:
I felt life was more relevant here; I figured the race
struggle is treated more significantly here —Morris
B. Abram, quoted in Current Biography, October
1965
In academic circles these days it is the fashion to be
relevant —Johns Hopkins Mag., December 1965
Great books are universally relevant and always contemporary —Mortimer J. Adler, Playboy, January
1966
They are demanding that colleges and universities be
socially and morally relevant —Kenneth B. Clark,
American Scholar, Winter 1966-1967
The relevance implicit in the adjective in these uses is
political or (especially) social relevance. As the usage
continued to be very common in the early 1970s, it
began to attract some unfavorable attention and soon
appeared for denigration in Strunk & White 1972, Harper 1975, and subsequent American handbooks. The
usage has also crossed the Atlantic, and so has the criticism: Howard 1984 reports its being decried in the
House of Lords.
The new sense has also been used in the more usual
constructions, but these uses have not drawn fire from
the critics:
. . . piously asserts the need for relevant social science on a giant scale —Irving Louis Horowitz & Lee
Rainwater, Trans-Action, June 1967
Education is supposed to be relevant to contemporary issues —Robert M. Hutchins, Center Mag.,
September 1968
. . . the importance of making the curriculum relevant to social issues —Philip G. Altbach, The Progressive, October 1969
Those who dislike the socially relevant relevant will
be glad to know that its popular usage has dropped off
considerably in recent years. It is, however, not defunct:
For all its scholarship, it is intensely relevant —H.
Jack Geiger, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 9 Jan. 1983
2. A number of commentators warn against the metathesized pronunciation and spelling revelvant. It sometimes turns up in surprising places:
. . . furnishes references where révélant to STC —
Times Literary Supp., 15 Oct. 1964
Se e METATHESIS.
reliable Lounsbury 1908 commented that the controversy over reliable was then a century or more old (he
did not say who started it, unfortunately) and showed
no signs of dying out. The issue was etymology: since
reliable means "able to be relied on" rather than "able
to rely," it was held to have been improperly formed. Its
critics were many. Lounsbury cited the English essayist
Thomas De Quincey. The OED says that Worcester's
1860 dictionary objected to the formation. Alford 1866
condemned the word. Richard Grant White 1870
devoted seven pages to its denunciation; in these he
found grounds for dismissing (to his own satisfaction)
the defense based on analogy with such similarly formed
words as available, indispensable, laughable, and unaccountable. (The analogical words were mentioned in
Webster 1864.) Reliable was placed on William Cullen
Bryant's 1877 Index Expurgatorius. In Great Britain it
was commonly condemned as an Americanism,
although De Quincey thought that Coleridge had coined
it. Neither guess was right; reliable had been in sporadic
use since the 16th century, but in frequent popular use
only since the middle of the 19th. Reliable looks like
another example of a usage issue brought on by a sudden increase in use.
In spite of Lounsbury's feeling that the issue would
not die soon, it did. The last serious objector we have
found is Bierce 1909. Reliable is mentioned in Utter
1916, but he only quotes the OED note and tells his
readers they can use trustworthy as an alternative if they
prefer. Hall 1917 gives an account of the controversy,
but more recent references are hard to find. Why did a
subject pursued with such vehemence for a century or
so suddenly lose interest? Since its real cause was apparently the noticeable increase in use in the mid-19th century, it probably died because people simply got used to
the word.
In any case, there is no usage problem with reliable
anymore.
relish When the noun relish is followed by a preposition, the preposition may be either of ox for. For is the
more common choice:
. . . a certain relish for debate —Bell Gale Chevigny,
Village Voice, 28 Feb. 1968
. . . the reader must have a relish for suspense —
Catherine Meyer, Harper's, May 1971
But of is also standard:
She had tremendous earthy relish of concrete manifestations of place and people —Ruth Suckow, College English, March 1953
. . . a relish of the trivia of the private lives of public
persons —J. H. Plumb, Saturday Rev., 28 June 1969
remand Bernstein 1958, 1965 and Harper 1975, 1985
caution against what they consider the redundant use of
back with remand. Their warnings may be unnecessary
remediable 812 renowned
in this case; remand back seems hardly ever to occur. In
fact, our files contain only a single instance of it:
He may be remanded back to prison for a little more
penitence —Karl Menninger, Avant-Garde, May
1968
See also REDUNDANCY.
remediable, remedial Several commentators distinguish between these words, but only two of them—Follett 1966 and Copperud 1970, 1980—explicitly state
that remediable and remedial are ever confused. Follett
cites an instance in which remedial, which means "serving or intended as a remedy," is used in place of remediable, which means "capable of being remedied." Our
files contain no other examples of such misuse. The
OED shows that the original meaning of remediable
was, in fact, "remedial," but the most recent evidence of
remediable in this obsolete sense is from 1596. What we
conclude from all of this is that these two words are
rarely confused. Here are a few examples of typical current use:
He noted the various remedial proposals that have
been made —Center Mag., November 1969
. . . he had begun this remedial reading with the firmest male prejudice of them all —Norman Mailer,
Harper's, March 1971
Happily, my problem was remediable —Carll
Tucker, Saturday Rev., 18 Mar. 1978
. . . at least partly remediable social wrongs —Irving
Howe, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 18 Apr. 1982
remedy When used with a preposition, remedy is
often followed by for:
Work was generally deplored as too drastic a remedy
for our unemployment —Cyril Connolly, The Condemned Playground, 1946
. . . she used to have only one remedy for every problem—a proper thrashing —André P. Brink, Looking
on Darkness, 1974
. . . we applied the human remedy, the remedy my
family had found in Saskatchewan for any unwanted
life —Wallace Stegner, Blair & Ketchum's Country
Jour., December 1979
Less frequently, it is found with against or to:
. . . the people's remedy against the abuse of government —Morris R. Cohen, The Faith of a Liberal,
1946
. . . to wait with growing impatience for the remedies
against tyranny —Times Literary Supp., June 1969
. . . controls offer no real remedy to inflation, but

remember See RECOLLECT, REMEMBER.
remind Two commentators (Bernstein 1965 and
Copperud 1964, 1970, 1980) issue warnings against
what they consider to be intransitive uses of this transitive verb. Here is one of our few examples of the usage
that they disapprove:
Your recent correspondence .. . reminds of a question —Times Literary Supp., 11 Feb. 1983
This is better regarded as an absolute use of the verb
than as a genuine intransitive; the direct object of
remind, me in this case, is missing but understood. The
OED labels such usage elliptical and illustrates it with
two 19th-century citations. But the correct label—
intransitive, absolute, or elliptical—is not really the
issue. The commentators who object to the use of
remind without an object do so because they find it unidiomatic, that is, because it does not sound right. Considering how rarely such usage occurs, we suspect that
this feeling is shared by most other readers and writers.
remunerate, remuneration These undeniably formal words are sometimes cited as pretentious substitutes for such ordinary alternatives as pay and payment.
Our evidence shows them to be most at home in writing
that concerns serious financial matters, especially when
large amounts of money—or other forms of compensation—are involved:
Marquand's post in the Ministry of Health is remunerated at the Cabinet rate .. . but does not carry
with it a seat in the Cabinet —Current Biography
1951
... where a company's income is extracted very
largely as directors' remuneration which is intended
to equalize year by year the tax burden —J. M. Cope,
Business Taxation, 1972
Copperud 1970, 1980 notes that remunerate is sometimes misspelled renumérote. We have an example of
this error in our files:
. . . the highest renumerated corporate executive in
the U.S. —Town & Country, March 1980
It is worth remembering that impressive words become
far less impressive when misspelled.
render Render in the sense "to give a performance
o f is pronounced "pretentious" by Copperud 1970,
1980 and "stilted" by Evans 1957. What they have in
mind are such uses as "The Star-Spangled Banner will
now be rendered by Miss Emily Brown," in which they
would prefer the straightforward sung. And so may you,
but note that render in this sense can also occur in contexts where it is neither pretentious nor stilted, as in this
example:
When I first came home May 1 from the hospital I
was hearing the celestial chorus—"Clementine" is
what it renders when I am weak enough to hear it.
Over & over.... The transfusion cut that out. Must
come from not enough blood getting to the head —
Flannery O'Connor, letter, 15 May 1964
renowned Copperud 1964, 1970, 1980 finds that
renown is commonly misused as an adjective equivalent
to renowned. We have a little evidence of this curious
error in our files:
. . . a world-renown authority on peregrines —Massachusetts Audubon News Letter, April 1971
. . . the woven fibers are renown for their soft, silky
texture —catalog, Britches of Georgetowne, Fall
1981
reoccur 813 replica
. . . a renown clinical psychologist —Cats Mag.,
December 1985
Perhaps such usage occurs because the final n of renown
is felt to be a participial ending, like the final n of known
or shown. Perhaps the reason is more obscure. All we
know for certain is that renown is not established as an
adjective in standard English. Use renowned instead.
Copperud also mentions the misspellings reknown
and reknowned. These are both attested in our files and
should be avoided.
reoccur, reoccurrence See RECUR, RECURRENCE,
REOCCUR, REOCCURRENCE.
repast Various commentators describe repast as stiff,
pretentious, obsolescent, or quaint. A look at the evidence shows it to be a somewhat literary word of fairly
low frequency that has lately begun to acquire some currency, probably because of the recent increase in writing
about food. It also has some literary use, in modern stories as well as older novels. Here are a few examples
from our files:
. . . Madame Foucault, who had herself served
Sophia with her invalid's repast —Arnold Bennett,
The Old Wives'Tale, 1908
. . . a splendid repast, with silver, crystal, damask, 3
roast goose —Ursula K. LeGuin, "The Rule of
Names," in Adventures for Readers (8th grade text),
ed. Egbert W. Nieman et al., 1979
One of the most delectable meals I have sampled in
a long while was a simple repast —Craig Claiborne,
N. Y. Times Mag., 20 Apr. 1986
repeat again Jensen 1935, Copperud 1980, and Shaw
1987 consider repeat again redundant for repeat. But
look at this example:
A theme was repeated again and again. In the middle
of frills, grace-notes, runs and catches it recurred
with a strange, almost holy, solemnity —James Stephens, The Crock of Gold, 1912
This is a perfect example of useful redundancy, for a discussion of which see REDUNDANCY.
repel See REPULSE, REPEL.
repetition See REDUNDANCY.
replete There is a sense of replete which some critics
regard as nonexistent. The problem has to do with the
use of replete as a synonym of complete. The OED,
which treats this sense of replete as standard, shows that
it has been used—although only rarely—since 1601,
when it occurred in Shakespeare's All's Well That Ends
Well. Its use has become more frequent in the 20th century, but it still is not especially common. The first to
criticize it was Fowler 1926, whose opinion has been
more or less repeated by such later commentators as
Evans 1957 and Harper 1975, 1985. The distinction
they draw between replete and complete begins from a
valid observation, that replete normally indicates fullness or abundance. To describe a book as "complete
with illustrations" is to simply say that it has illustrations, but to describe it as "replete with illustrations" is
to say that it has illustrations in abundance. As far as
the critics are concerned, that is where the story ends,
but in fact replete is also sometimes used in standard
writing to mean "complete," as in the following
passages:
. . . stylized landscape of Deep South farmland at
sundown, replete with wheeling buzzards and eroding soil —Time, 19 Mar. 1945
. . . an elderly doctor replete with whiskers and a
young wife who does not love him —Newsweek, 5
Mar. 1951
. . . preferred to come on .. . with all the solemnity
of the risen Christ, replete with white cotton pajamas, incense, and the stigmata of his legal persecutions —Theodore Roszak, The Making of a Counter
Culture, 1969
. . . Mr. Gatien's new nightclub-cum-discotheque...
a former Episcopal church replete with altars and
crucifixes —Laura Landro, Wall Street Jour., 29
Nov. 1983
Replete may have been chosen by some of these writers
because it has connotations of abundance and opulence
even when its basic denotation is simply "complete."
replica Replica is used in the fine arts with the narrow
meaning of a copy or reproduction of a work of art made
by or under the supervision of the original artist. Fowler
1926, 1965, Bernstein 1958, 1965, 1977, and Shaw 1975,
1987 believe this to be the only proper sense; Kilpatrick
1984 knows it is not but wishes it were. The evidence in
the OED suggests, however, that the word has been
applied loosely since the middle of the 19th century,
when it was first introduced into English. In present-day
use it more often refers to a reproduction of some artifact than to a work of art and frequently is used of a
miniaturized copy. It is also used figuratively. Some
examples:
At the moment, a replica of the Mayflower—or,
rather, what purports to be a replica, for nobody
knows exactly what the ship looked like—is being
built in England —E. J. Kahn, Jr., New Yorker, 1
Oct. 1955
The Langley Research Center has designed, constructed, and tested a 1/5-scale replica model of the
Saturn SA-1 launch vehicle —Harry L. Runyan &
Robert W. Leonard, Structures for Space Operations,
December 1962
. . . chemists learned how to make laboratory replicas of increasingly complex natural products —
Barry Commoner, New Yorker, 2 Oct. 1971
Bottex now sits beside the cathedral and paints replicas of "The Last Supper" for tourists. But he uses the
visitor's face for the Judas —Caleb Pirtle III, Southern Living, November 1971
. . . building a bridge that was said to be an exact replica of one of the bridges that Caesar built across the
Rhine —Merle Miller, Plain Speaking, 1973
. . . transforming some of the shore and lake country
of southern Maine .. . into replicas of suburban
shopping malls —Morgan McGinley, NY. Times,
12 Aug. 1984
Three musical shows, all rehearsing under the
impression that they were replicas of "South
Pacific," opened and folded in jig time —Groucho
Marx, letter, 3 Oct. 1950
reprisal 814 request
Intensifying adjectives such as exact, authentic, and
perfect are sometimes used with replica to stress fidelity
of detail. They are harmless, and at any rate are more
common in advertising matter than in other contexts.
reprisal Bernstein 1965 notes that reprisal "takes
preposition for (an act); against or upon (the perpetrator)," but actual usage is less clear-cut. The most common preposition following reprisal seems to be against,
and while it is true that a reprisal is usually against a
"perpetrator," we also have evidence for its occasional
use when an "act" is involved:
The seizure may have been a reprisal against the
action of the Privy Council in London —Theodore
Hsi-en Chen, Current History, November 1952
In "All Quiet" waggish reprisals against non-coms
were still possible —Frederic Morton, Saturday
Rev., 22 May 1954
. . . any terrorist act by any Arab or Jew can properly
be the occasion for a reprisal against any Jew or Arab
—Noam Chomsky, Columbia Forum, Winter 1969
. . . I think we can say that Bech, at least in part, represents a reprisal, and a healthy one, against the literary establishment —L. E. Sissman, Atlantic,
August 1970
Upon seems to occur with reprisal very seldom now, but
on does have some use. It occurs in the same contexts
as against, but less frequently:
.. . lest Mr. Raycie's mysterious faculty of hearing
what was said behind his back should bring sudden
reprisals on the venerable lady —Edith Wharton,
False Dawn, 1924
. . . had considered it a peculiarly unfortunate feature
of Jackson's proposal for reprisal on French shipping
—Francis D. Wormuth, "The Vietnam War: The
President versus the Constitution," 1968
Reprisal is also used with for in the way noted by
Bernstein:
. . . in reprisal for maltreatment of an American
naval lieutenant —Francis D. Wormuth, "The Vietnam War: The President versus the Constitution,"
1968
And we also have one example of reprisal used with to:
... U.S. goods are spontaneously boycotted by the
population in reprisal to our increase of duties —S.
J. Rundt, Wall Street Jour., 2 Sept. 1954
repugnance When repugnance is used with a preposition, it is usually to:
... her instinctive dignity and repugnance to any
show of emotion —George Eliot, Silas Marner, 1861
. . . a deep-seated repugnance to monopoly in almost
any form —Neil J. Curry, Atlantic, December 1955
Other prepositions sometimes used with repugnance are
for, toward, or towards:
... they headed for a place prostrated by war which
also shared their repugnance for arms —George
Weller, Saturday Evening Post, 1 Sept. 1956
. . . without at the same time restraining her repugnance toward the political philosophy of the Fascist
states —Maurice Halperin, Foreign Affairs, October
1940
. . . having so far overcome his repugnance towards
the language employed in their theoretical writings
—Times Literary Supp., 8 Oct. 1954
Repugnance was also once used with against, as the
OED shows, but we have no evidence that such usage
still occurs.
repulse, repel Quite a few commentators—Evans
1957, Bernstein 1962, 1965, Bremner 1980, Copperud
1970, 1980, Shaw 1975, 1987, Bryson 1984, Freeman
1983—insist on a distinction between the figurative uses
of repel and repulse. What this distinction amounts to is
disapproval of the sense of repulse that means "to cause
repulsion in." Bernstein illustrates the desired distinction with this sentence:
She repulsed the suitor because he repelled her.
Here repulse means basically "to drive off or turn
away," which is its oldest sense (and which, incidentally, is also a sense of repel). Repulse is often used in
this sense, as Bernstein suggests, and repel is often used
to mean "to cause repulsion in":
. . . she had learned to be on the watch and to repulse
advances that were disagreeable —Ellen Glasgow,
Barren Ground, 1925
A teacher embittered by personal disappointment
can hurt and repulse with corrosive wit the timid or
groping student —Donald H. Morrison, N. Y. Times
Mag., 16 Oct. 1955
. . . the inevitable promiscuity attached to a sexual
search repelled him —Norman Mailer, Harper's,
March 1971
. . . he was personally repelled by some of the racial
policies of the Metropolitan Club in Washington —
Gay Talese, Harper's, January 1969
But repulse is also used like repel, as in these examples:
. . . Malone sat trembling on the edge of the table,
repulsed by his own weakness and distress —Carson
McCullers, Botteghe Oscure, Quaderno XI, 1953
Hoarding repulses Mr. Risolo, the barber —Philip
Hawkins, Wall Street Jour., 5 Oct. 1966
People who had been repulsed by his wartime pamphleteering were eager to forget him —John W. Aldridge, Saturday Rev., 1 Aug. 1976
The suggestion in Copperud and Evans that it is an error
to associate repulse with repulsion has no foundation;
both words are derived from the same Latin word, and
there is no logical reason they should not share senses.
You will, of course, feel free to observe the distinction
between repulse and repel urged by the commentators if
you find it useful to do so. But it is one thing to observe
the distinction yourself and another to insist that other
people observe it too. The distinction itself does not
seem to be an especially helpful one. The context in all
our citations for repulse makes it clear which sense is
being used. Repel is, however, far more common in the
disputed sense than is repulse. The choice is yours.
request A number of British commentators, from
Fowler 1926 to Longman 1988, and one American,
resemblance 815 resource
Bernstein 1958, 1965, have objected to the use of for
after the verb request. Here is Bernstein's example:
The President has requested Congress for both these
powers — N.Y. Times, 28 Feb. 1957
The opinion of all the commentators is that this construction is based on analogy with ask, common in the
same construction, and that it is unidiomatic (or incorrect). Another influence may be the noun request, which
is common wither:
. . . the request for the release of Archbishop Slipyi
—Norman Cousins, Saturday Rev., 30 Oct. 1971
At any rate, the construction appears to be rare in
print. We have only one example besides those given by
Fowler and Bernstein:
. . . Prime Minister Attlee has requested President
Truman for renewed American efforts —Current
History, November 1951
Such usage should not be confused with the use of
request with for in a construction like the following, in
which request has an impersonal object:
Indian officials requested the area for Indian families
—American Guide Series: Minnesota, 1938
The impersonal object can also be followed by of.
... the machine could begin to request specific
things of the child —Johns Hopkins Mag., April
1966
resemblance When resemblance is followed by a
preposition, the preposition is usually to:
. . . a resemblance to one of his own targets —
Phoebe-Lou Adams, Atlantic, February 1972
He bears little resemblance to the characters he has
portrayed —Claire Safran, Redbook, July 1974
In another common construction, between follows
resemblance:
. . . to discover any resemblance between the two situations —Edith Wharton, The Age of Innocence,
1920
. . . the resemblance between this correspondence
and the epistolary novel —Times Literary Supp., 19
Feb. 1971
Bernstein 1965 indicates that resemblance is also followed by among, and that seems not altogether implausible. We have, however, no evidence for resemblance
among.
resentment Resentment is not very particular about
the prepositions that follow it. We have evidence for
more than a half-dozen, the most common of which are
at, of, and against:
She felt no resentment at this miscarriage of her
preparations —John Cheever, The Wapshot Chronicle, 1957
. . . to gratify an old man's resentment of skepticism
—Anthony Boucher, Far and Away, 1955
. . . resentment against other poets' prizes —Martin
Green, MX. Times Book Rev., 19 Dec. 1976
Other possibilities are toward (or towards) and, much
less often, over and for:
. . . a great deal of children's resentment toward
school in general —Bruno Bettelheim, Ladies'
Home Jour., September 1971
. . . French resentment over Secretary Dulles' recent
speech —Roscoe Drummond, Town Jour., January
1954
. . . not because of resentment for his hard youth —
Sherwood Anderson, Poor White, 1920
reside Reside, in one of its senses, is a slightly formalsounding word meaning "to live in a place as a legal residence"—or, put perhaps more simply, "to live officially." It is a word used in legal contexts, in rules, in
constitutions (including the U.S. Constitution), and in
other such writings. In more general works, it is used in
books of brief biographies and similar works of reference. Usage writers have been disparaging it as highfalutin from Ayres 1881 to Longman 1988. Surely this
misses the mark: the writers of biographical sketches
and the like must use live over and over, and reside is
an acceptable alternative once in a while. And, as Harper 1975, 1985 (the word's only defender) points out, it
is useful in contrasting a place of residence with, for
instance, a place of employment.
Here is how reference-book writers use reside:
... was born on March 31, 1912, in Chicago, where
his brother and three sisters still reside —Current
Biography, July 1967
. . . daughter of a wealthy English architect and
builder residing in New York —Dictionary of American Biography, 1929
These uses are perfectly acceptable. And remember that
you can use reside to elevate your style on purpose. Here
it is used to add to a tone of solemn denunciation:
"James," he said, "there is a particular place in hell,
in fact its innermost heart, where reside for eternity
the tormented souls of men of your sort...." —E.
L. Doctorow, Loon Lake, 1979
resort See RESOURCE.
resource Fowler 1926 cites several sentences in which
resource is mistakenly used in place of recourse and
resort in such phrases as have recourse to and in the last
resort. A few later commentators (Partridge 1942, Evans
1957, Copperud 1970, 1980, and Phythian 1979) have
repeated Fowler's warnings against such misuse, and
one recent British dictionary (Longman 1984) continues
to describe it as "a common confusion." Our evidence,
however, does not agree. We do have a few citations,
most of them from the 19th century, in which resource
is used when either recourse or resort seems possible,
and perhaps preferable to modern ears:
. . . finally resolved that it could be the last resource,
if her private inquiries .. . were unfavourably
answered —Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, 1813
But we have no clear-cut examples of mistaken use
other than the ones cited by Fowler. We do not doubt
that some confusion may still occur, but our lack of evidence strongly suggests that it is not at all common in
respect 816 responsibility
edited prose. Current writers appear to have little trouble keeping resource distinct from recourse and resort:
... must now learn to function as a resource to her
colleagues —Barbara Aiello, N.Y. Times, 25 Apr.
1976
. . . the idea of a library as a cultural resource persists
—O. B. Hardison, Jr., Entering the Maze, 1981
They dry well, too, I am told, without recourse to
messy boxes of borax or gel —Eleanor Perenyi,
Green Thoughts, 1983
In the last resort, Hitler's sense of destiny was his
doom —Terence Prittie, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 26
Sept. 1976
respect Respect occurs in a few idiomatic phrases
that have been involved in one usage issue or another
over the years. For instance, Bierce 1909 objected to
respect in the sense "way, matter," which is used in such
phrases as in that respect. Such phrases are, of course,
perfectly standard:
More representative in this respect was Lord Chesterfield —John Butt, English Literature in the MidEighteenth Century, edited & completed by Geoffrey
Carnall, 1979
In one other respect Johnson proposed to improve
upon his predecessors —John Butt, English Literature in the Mid-Eighteenth Century, edited & completed by Geoffrey Carnall, 1979
And Quiller-Couch 1916 objected to in respect of as
jargonish. Respect occurs in three such phrases: in
respect of, in respect to, and with respect to. For a discussion of these phrases, see IN RESPECT OF, IN RESPECT TO,
WITH RESPECT TO.
respective, respectively There is quite a bit of opinion about respective and respectively in print, and except
for the early and unheeded recommendation of Bierce
1909 that several replace respective, it all concerns the
familiar use of the two words in matching sets of things
in the correct order.
. . . we will continue to use the conventional symbols
NP, VP, AP, and PP for the maximal projections of
N, V, A, and P, respectively —Noam Chomsky,
Knowledge of Language, 1986
Respective and respectively also have a distributive function that assigns separate things to members of a group
referred to by a plural noun:
. . . blows up an atomic energy plant during dedication ceremonies, respectively killing and injuring the
daughters of two Supreme Court justices —Publishers Weekly, 17 June 1983
The gist of the commentary is that respective and respectively are often used where not strictly necessary (does
Chomsky really need respectively to help you match NP
with N, etc.?) and, even when correctly used, should be
avoided because they tend to slow down the progress of
the reader.
The points made by the critics are worth remembering, but so is the point that there are times when a writer
wants to slow readers down to make sure they are paying attention. Chomsky's material does not look like
easy going, and he may be inserting the respectively to
remind readers not to let their eyes glaze over in the
midst of a bunch of symbolic representations. "Pay
attention," he seems to say, "I'll be asking questions
later." (Chomsky probably does need to prod; our
excerpt above omits such additional symbols as X, X,
and X".)
The uses in the three examples that follow are all of
the kind that would be called unnecessary by the commentators. The first two are harmless, mere reminders
of individuality. The third is surely otiose, a classic
example of omissible respectively.
... the .. . result of this arrangement is, that such
men as have female companions with them pass
their time in prowling about the precincts of the
"ladies' apartment"; while their respective ladies
pop their heads first out of one door and then out of
another —Fanny Kemble, Journal of a Residence on
a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839, 1863
She analyzes CDs, stocks, bonds, options, mutual

responsibility A person is usually said to have a
responsibility for something and to someone:
The responsibility for engineering the line of cars
which in 1908 evolved the immortal Model T —
John Kenneth Galbraith, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 28
Feb. 1954
. . . Joachim not only assumed personal responsibility for his future study but became his part-time

Robert Evett, Atlantic, September 1970
. . . Landau's piece, examining the fan's, and the
journalist's responsibility to rock stars —Lawrence
Dietz, Los Angeles Times Book Rev., 23 May 1971
Responsibility is also frequently followed by of, which
occurs in the same contexts as for:
. . . he determined to take upon his own shoulders
the responsibility of organizing some amusements
—Thomas Hardy, The Mayor of Casterbridge, 1886
. . . it laid the whole responsibility of the war upon
Britain —Manchester Guardian Weekly, 27 Oct.
1939
The banks had the responsibility of the amalgamation of industries —The Autobiography of William
Allen White, 1946
Other prepositions that sometimes occur with responsibility include about, in, and toward (or towards):
Things you've had to take responsibility about really
should have been mine —Angus Wilson, The Middle Age of Mrs. Eliot, 1958
. . . federal responsibility in civil rights shifted from
the Department of Justice to a broad government

responsibility toward society —John P. Marquand,
Atlantic, November 1947
The idea that he has any responsibility towards Amy
or should feel any affection for their son —Times
Literary Supp., 29 June 1967
responsible The use of responsible with reference to
an impersonal noun (as in "The blizzard was responsible for three deaths") seems to have originated in American English sometime around the turn of the century.
Its occurrence in American English is now common and
entirely reputable:
. . . to discover the variables responsible for the
occurrence of an event —Howard H. Kendler, Basic
Psychology, 2d éd., 1968
. . . believe that racial discrimination was responsible —David M. Rafky, Change, October 1971
Some critics have argued that only a human being can
be considered truly responsible—that is, answerable—
and that responsible should therefore be used only of
people. But that argument, which dates back to Bierce
1909, is now rarely heard in the U.S. The use of responsible with an impersonal subject is still occasionally criticized by British commentators (such as Sellers 1975),
and doubtless there are still some American purists who
regard it with disapproval, but no American commentator that we know of has found fault with it for more
than thirty years.
restaurateur, restauranteur The word restaurateur
was borrowed into English from French at the end of the
18th century. Several decades later, according to written
evidence, restaurant was similarly borrowed. In the
years since, restaurant has become an extremely common English word, but restaurateur has remained
uncommon—or, at least, far less common than restaurant. This difference in frequency of use has given rise
to the variant form restauranteur, pronounced and
spelled with an n. Our first written evidence of restauranteur is from the 1920s:
The individual restauranteur is helpless —New
Yorker, 20 Feb. 1926
Why should a restauranteur hold fast to his ancient
traditions .. . ? —Harper's, September 1926
In current English, restauranteur is quite common in
speech and fairly common in writing:
. . . fellow Houston restauranteurs —Tom Curtis,
Inc. Mag., August 1982
. . . respected cooking teacher, cookbook author and
restauranteur —Publishers Weekly, 17 Sept. 1982
Restaurateur is the usual written form, especially in
writing that has passed under a copy editor's eye, but
restauranteur is a standard secondary variant.
restive Richard Grant White 1870 seems to have
been the first to make an issue of this word: "Restive
means standing stubbornly still, not frisky, as some people seem to think it does." Ayres 1881 and Vizetelly
1906 noted a reply by Fitzedward Hall, who adduced
proofs that the ordinary sense of restive had always been
"unruly, intractable, refractory." Ayres even noted that
the contemporary Webster 1864 carried a definition
"impatient, uneasy." There the matter seemed to rest,
although Bierce 1909 grumbled. Fowler 1926 ignored
the matter, and Krapp 1927 thought restive showed
signs of passing out of use altogether, like its earlier form
restiff. But the issue has flared up again among some
recent commentators (Gowers in Fowler 1965, Follett
1966, Bernstein 1977, Phythian 1979), with the emphasis now on defending the sense "unruly, intractable"
against the old Webster's sense, which has been reinterpreted as "restless."
The definition mentioned by Ayres reads in full:
"Impatient under coercion, chastisement, or opposition; uneasy." This sense has become the most common
one in present-day English. Since the dictionary in
which it appears was published in 1864, the sense had
been in use for more than a century when the latest set
of critics began to denigrate it. Its connotations are not
quite the same as those of restless:
He did right to preach to women: men would not
have listened to him. As it was, Miss Joy Blewins,
and Mrs. M'Murphy, were restive —George Meredith, The Ordeal of Richard Feverel, 1859
They were all becoming restive under the monotonous persistence of the missionary —Willa Cather,
Death Comes for the Archbishop, 1927
The audience was growing restive; there was some
stamping of feet at the back —J. B. Priestley, The
Good Companions, 1929
We sat a restive hour after starting time and at nine
o'clock a solitary man .. . came before the curtain to
ask us to bear with him five minutes longer —Robert
Frost, letter, 10 Nov. 1920
The connotations here are more of impatience than of
restlessness. Here are a few quite recent examples:
. . . the audience, restive after the long public hearing, repeatedly interrupted the council's discussions
—Sue Lewis, Denver Post, 8 Sept. 1984
. . . were becoming increasingly restive with their
economic lot —John F. Baker, Publishers Weekly,
12 Mar. 1982
Now, the Sudan would prove susceptible to the message of a messiah, its people restive under Egypt's
corrupt rule —John H. Waller, Military History,
June 1985
Notice how easily the last example could have developed from this one two centuries earlier:
. . . your colonies become suspicious, restive, and
untractable —Edmund Burke, (Speech on) Conciliation with America, 1775
The sense of "resisting control, balky" has not vanished in the 20th century, as a few commentators fear:
The most comical sights in the parade were the
mounted Navy and Air Force officers, who joggled
along unhappily on their restive horses —Mollie
Panter-Downes, New Yorker, 13 June 1953
The United States also was finding its other allies
increasingly restive. They were less inclined to follow the U.S. lead — Newsweek, 13 July 1953
. . . their minorities .. . are becoming progressively
more demonstrative and restive in their opposition
—Claude A. Buss, Wilson Library Bulletin, November 1968
restrictive appositives 818 revenge
restrictive appositives See APPOSITIVES.
reticent, reticence Reticent has recently developed a
new sense, and usage watchers are not keeping quiet
about it. In its older, better established uses, reticent can
mean "inclined to be silent":
An extremely reticent man, Morris does not like to
talk about his experience in personal terms —Helen
Dudar, N.Y. Times Mag., 30 Oct. 1977
or "restrained in expression or appearance":
. . . two or three rather reticent abstract paintings —
Jay Jacobs, Gourmet, January 1979
In its disputed sense, reticent is synonymous with reluctant or hesitant:
Bankers naturally are reticent to pay steep rates on
deposits—William D. Hartley, Wall Street Jour., 29
Dec. 1969
This sense may have developed in the following way.
With reticent in its "inclined to be silent" sense, a person may be said to be "reticent about" a particular subject. With a slight extension of meaning, a person may
be said to be "reticent about discussing" a particular
subject, in which case reticent is being used essentially
as a synonym of hesitant, but still in a context that
relates specifically to speech. The next step would be the
use of reticent with an infinitive, still relating to speech:
. . . its sponsors, not reticent to affirm their aspiration —Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress,
1952
They were disturbed .. . by my being reticent to talk
about the collision —Peter Taylor, The Old Forest
and Other Stories, 1985
Here reticent even more clearly means "hesitant" or
"reluctant." In the final step, its associations with
speech are entirely lost:
. . . bluefish are extremely reticent to strike surface
poppers —Robert P. Lawton, Massachusetts Wildlife, May-June 1980
"But I'm reticent," she said, "to use real shells in my
work...." —Angela Cummings, quoted in Town &
Country, My 1981
. . . taxpayers have been reticent to put up the money
—Connie Chung, television news broadcast, 24 Aug.
1985
The same extension of meaning has occurred with the
noun reticence:
Retailers' reticence to place Christmas orders until
late in the season —Stanley H. Slom, Wall Street
Jour., 19 Sept. 1972
. . . criticized the reticence of West European governments to support American sanctions —N. Y. Times,
19 Mar. 1980
Arafat's reticence to talk is understandable —Peter
Carlson, People, 1 Aug. 1983
However this new sense developed, there is no denying that it is now well established in the language, and
chances are that it will grow more common in years to
come. There is also no denying, however, that many
people, including several usage commentators, regard it
as an error. If you use it, do not be surprised to find
yourself being corrected.
return back This is another verb phrase that is sometimes cited (by Shaw 1987, for example) as redundant.
Back is, of course, not needed with return; it is simply a
little reinforcement that is occasionally added to make
sure the reader or hearer does not miss the point. The
combination is an old one:
. . . the bill must be sent to Murry, accepted by him,
and then returned back —Jonathan Swift, Journal to
Stella,! June 1711
. .. when that's done, 'twill be time to return back to
the parlour fire-side, where we left my uncle Toby in
the middle of his sentence —Laurence Sterne, Tristram Shandy, 1760
. . . I shall return back to Venice in a few days —
Lord Byron, letter, 12 May 1817
See REDUNDANCY.
Rev. See REVEREND, REV.
revel Bernstein 1965 says that revel is used with the
preposition in, and most of the time it is:
. . . revelling in its barber shop quavers —Eugene
O'Neill, The Great God Brown, 1926
. . . I fairly revelled in reminiscent sympathy with
him —Max Beerbohm, Seven Men, 1920
. . . a woman .. . reveling in the violent surge of her
blood —William Styron, Lie Down in Darkness,
1951
. . . it revels in name-calling —Daniels 1983
Once in a while revel can be found with at, around, on,
or with. Of these only at is used like in, to connect the
verb with the object of revelry.
. . . they reveled at his cockiness —A. H. Raskin,
N. Y. Times Mag., 1 Nov. 1976
. . . a brilliant scapegrace who had .. . revelled
around Europe for years —Herman Wouk, Marjorie
Morningstar, 1955
. . . was revelling on the fat of the land in Philadelphia —Samuel Eliot Morison & Henry Steele Commager, The Growth of the American Republic, 3d éd.,
1942
. . . a school teacher afraid life is passing her by,
revels with Arthur O'Connell —N. Y. Times Mag.,
25 Dec. 1955
revenge 1. See AVENGE, REVENGE.
2. The noun revenge is often followed by on, against, or
for. The first two of these prepositions mark the object
of the revenge, the last its motive.
. . . an act of revenge on their greatness —David
Denby, Atlantic, September 1971
It often takes revenge on civilians —Max Clos, N. Y.
Times Mag., 10 Jan. 1965
. . . thirsting for revenge against his "friend and successor" —William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the
Third Reich, 1960
Reverend 819 reward
Is this some kind of revenge for what happened to
your sister? —John Masters, Fandango Rock, 1959
Reverend, Rev. Concern over the proper use of Reverend and its abbreviation Rev. in addressing American
Protestant clergymen goes back at least to Richard
Grant White 1870; it has continued unabated in usage
books, etiquette books, and the public prints ever since.
The usual prescriptions can be easily summed up: Reverend is an adjective; it is not a title; it should be preceded by the; it should be followed by a surname or a
title such as Dr. or Mr.; therefore, it is wrong to address
a clergyman, as President Reagan did in 1981, as "Reverend Moomaw."
A few usage books, such as Reader's Digest 1983,
Copperud 1980, and Harper 1975, 1985, acknowledge
that these prescriptions do not reflect actual usage and
that many American Protestant denominations do not
follow them. (The prescriptions reflect primarily the
practice of the Church of England and American Episcopalians.) The prescriptions have a couple of other
weaknesses, for Reverend is in fact used as a title, and it
is also used as a noun (and has been since the 17th
century).
This is primarily an American problem because of
history: the forms prescribed now did not come into use
in England until the 18th century, and early English settlers in this country brought the older prevailing practice—in which the was omitted regularly and the surname omitted at least some of the time. So early
American Protestant practice continued forms that later
went out of style in England.
There seems to be considerably greater acceptance of
such forms as "Reverend Moomaw" than most authorities recognize. The Harper usage panel, for instance,
gave 50 percent acceptance to the omission of the, 45
percent acceptance to the omission of the surname, and
40 percent acceptance to Reverend by itself as a form of
address. Reader's Digest says many churches freely use
those forms.
If you are trying to be really careful, then, you will
need to learn the preferred or accepted forms for the
church in question, perhaps by, as Reader's Digest suggests, asking your own clergyman. In a pinch you can
probably make do with the old prescribed forms.
The abbreviation Rev. is subjected to the same restrictions as Reverend by most of the usage books. But as
these three examples show, heterodox usage is as well
entrenched for the abbreviation as it is for Reverend:
Rev. John Hayes of Salem or Rev. W. Wolcott of
this city will answer questions with regard to me —
Robert Frost, letter, 11 Sept. 1897
. . . Rev. Harris was Chaplain for the Senate when I
was V.P. —Harry S. Truman, diary, 8 Feb. 1948
The release of Rev. Jenco did little to mitigate their
unhappiness —77?^ Tower Commission Report,
1987
There is, clearly, acceptable usage other than that prescribed in most of the stylebooks, handbooks, and etiquette books. Again, this is really a matter of etiquette
more than linguistic propriety, and the preference of the
clergy involved should be taken into account if it can be
determined.
More detail will be found in Harper 1975, 1985. There
are several pages of historical material on the subject in
Mencken 1963 (abridged), and an extensive treatment
appears in "Speaking of the Clergy" by Lillian M. Feinsilver in American Speech, Summer 1983. (She even
finds variation in the forms of addressing American
Jewish clergy.)
revert Although revert back is frequently cited as a
redundancy (see REDUNDANCY), its occurrence in edited
writing is not rare:
. . . would also revert back to Panama after a specified time —Current Biography, June 1968
. . . international conflict reverted back to a struggle
between whole systems —Stephen A. Garrett, Center Mag., July/August 1971
A conversion is always imminent; one cannot revert
back to a lower level of consciousness —Joyce Carol
Oates, Saturday Rev., November 1972
But our evidence does show that revert by itself occurs
far more often:
. . . to revert to the discussion of tragedy for a
moment —Richard Schickel, Harper's, March 1971
. . . with the land reverting to forests —Jack Swedberg, Massachusetts Wildlife, May-June 1976
. .. often revert to an earlier stage of their development —Changing Times, March 1980
review, revue Review has many meanings, but revue
has only one: "a theatrical production consisting typically of satirical skits, songs, and dances." That also
happens to be one of the meanings of review:
... American composer of many musical reviews —
The Dance Encyclopedia, éd. Anatole Chujoy, 1949
His opportunity to appear in a Broadway musical
review —Current Biography 1953
.. . the Shanghai Theatre .. . with three blue films
which were shown in the intervals of a nude review
—Graham Greene, Travels with My Aunt, 1969
Review acquired this sense from revue, which was the
name given these shows when they first became popular
in Paris during the 19th century. The shows were —and
often still are—intended to satirically review current
events; hence the name revue, which is simply the
French word for "review." Perhaps because of this etymological connection, usage commentators are generally tolerant toward the use of review as a synonym (or,
if you prefer, a spelling variant) of revue. The only critics
explicitly rejecting such use are Phythian 1979 and the
Oxford American Dictionary. Others, such as Evans
1957 and Copperud 1964, consider review acceptable
but prefer revue. So, apparently, do most writers and
editors. Our evidence shows that revue is appreciably
more common than review in this sense.
reward The usual idiom with this verb calls for your
being rewarded for something done, with or sometimes
by something desirable, and by an agent, which need not
be human. Thus the by construction can either indicate
the reward or its giver. Both by uses do not, of course,
occur in the same sentence.
. . . rewarded them for outstanding work —Harry
Levinson, Think, May-June 1967
. . . individuals who, while not technically public servants, are rewarded .. . with public money for per-
rhetoric 820
rich
forming a public service —Roy Lewis & Angus
Maude, The English Middle Classes, 1950
. . . made a mild pun involving Latin and was
rewarded with an immediate laugh —Jacques Barzun, Atlantic, December 1953
. . . books whose theme was that if the poor are virtuous, they are always rewarded by wealth and honor
—Collier's Year Book, 1949
. . . was never rewarded by the least glimpse of the
celebrated Lady Paignton —J. D. Beresford, Jacob
Stahl, 1911
. . . portrait painting applauded & rewarded by the
rich & great —William Blake, Annotations to Sir
Joshua Reynolds' Works, ca. 1808
. . . you will be well rewarded by a visit to the Marine
Historical Association's unique museum —Dana
Burnet, New England Journeys, No. 2, 1954
rhetoric In ancient times—in the days of Aristotle
and before—rhetoric was simply the art of speaking and
writing effectively, the art of persuasion. Rhetoric was a
subject of study at least as early as the time of Socrates,
when it was taught by itinerant teachers known as Sophists to any free male Athenian citizen who could afford
it and who wanted to improve his powers of persuasion
in the councils of the city-state.
Rhetoric continued to be a subject of study into the
Middle Ages, which was when the word rhetoric came
into English. The study of rhetoric had by then, of
course, long recognized certain standard methods of
embellishment in speech and writing, and the word rhetoric in English soon began to be applied to those methods too, as in this 20th-century example:
The Senate soon found that if he spoke with studied
elegance in favour of a motion he meant that he
wanted it voted against, and that if he spoke with
studied elegance against it this meant that he wanted
it passed; and that on the very few occasions when
he spoke briefly and without any rhetoric he meant
to be taken literally —Robert Graves, /, Claudius,
1934
So if rhetoric could refer to the heightening of speech by
the application of traditional devices, it would be no
great stretch to use it to refer to that heightening or those
devices in a depreciatory way, as belonging more to
form than to substance. Such use began in the 17th century, according to evidence in the OED. It was still
occurring in the late 19th and early 20th centuries:
He owes his superiority to a resolution to look facts
in the face, instead of being put off by flimsy rhetoric
—Leslie Stephen, History of English Thought in the
18th Century, 1876
My brother Clarke uttered a larmoyant dissent that
seemed to me more sentiment and rhetoric than reasoning —Oliver Wendell Holmes d. 1935, letter, 29
Mar. 1922
It looks like mere "rhetoric," certainly not "deeds
and language such as men do use." It appears to us,
in fact, forced and flagitious bombast —T. S. Eliot,
"Ben Jonson," in Selected Essays, 1932
That passage, Sir, is not empty rhetoric —Virginia
Woolf, Three Guineas, 1938
So far this use had not raised a single eyebrow. But
then came the 1960s and its sometimes unruly and
unkempt students demanding "relevance" and damning
"rhetoric." Rhetoric became rather a vogue word, and
commentators like Edwin Newman soon discovered it:
Still worse is the destruction of rhetoric. Rhetoric
does not mean fustian, exaggeration, or grand and
empty phrases.... Suddenly beloved of politicians
and journalists, rhetoric is now used to mean something doubtful and not quite honest.... Its misapplication could hardly tell more than it does —Newman 1974
Newman obviously did not realize that his newly discovered misapplication had been recorded in dictionaries published well before he was born, such as the
Century of 1897, Webster 1909, and the OED (the volume covering R was published in 1910). Other commentators who have largely repeated Newman's criticism include Bremner 1980, Kilpatrick 1984, and
Harper 1975, 1985. Critical commentary in the newspapers has come from William Safire (N. Y. Times Book
Rev., 6 June 1976) and Andrew Knight, a British writer,
who in the New York Times for 7 May 1978 asserted
that Americans had changed the meaning of rhetoric by
using it only pejoratively—a curious assertion since
Evans 1957, before the deluge, commented that the
pejorative sense was primarily British.
But you need not concern yourself greatly with this
minor issue. The pristine old sense of rhetoric is still in
respectable use, and so are the senses from which the
depreciatory sense developed. Nothing has really happened except that the depreciatory sense has gained
wider circulation than it used to have.
rhinoceros The plural of rhinoceros seems to have
vexed a great many writers, to judge from the wide variety of plurals shown in the OED. The variety has boiled
down to three in present-day use: rhinoceroses, the most
common, and rhinoceros and rhinoceri. Rhinoceri has
occasionally been disapproved (Evans 1957), apparently
because of its irregular formation, but has been used at
least occasionally since the end of the 18th century.
. . . the African giants—elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses —Barbara Ford, Saturday Rev., 5 Aug.
1972
. . . land-based creatures that have since disappeared:
elephants, buffalo, rhinoceros —Frederic V. Grunfeld, The Reporter, 14 July 1966
. . . the perissodactyls, dwindled to a few tapirs and
myopic rhinoceri in my own era —John Updike,
New Yorker, 14 Aug. 1971
rich When used with a preposition, rich is most often
found with in:
. . . a dog rich in leisure and in meditation —Sinclair
Lewis, Babbitt, 1922
. . . no nation is rich enough in diplomatic talent —
Hans J. Morgenthau, New Republic, 18 Apr. 1955
. . . Beecham's "Capriccio Italien," if not so rich in
sound, is richer in spirit —Irving Kolodin, Saturday
Rev., 26 June 1954
Retrospective wisdom (in which we're all rich) —
Irving Howe, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 7 Nov. 1976
rid 821 right
It is also found less frequently with with:
... life .. . in all its manifold complexity, rich with
its unnoticed and unrecorded little happenings —
Thomas Wolfe, You Can't Go Home Again, 1940
Life for her was rich with promise. She was to see
herself fulfilled —D. H. Lawrence, Sons and Lovers,
1913
rid Rid is now almost always used with of:
. . . I set out to rid myself of a sneaky city prose style
—Garrison Keillor, New Yorker, 18 Sept. 1971
. . . distinguished people who simply could not rid
themselves of the notion that Europe was the home
of the arts —Edmund Wilson, A Piece of My Mind,
1956
. . . had not yet completely rid itself of the stillness
of night —Hamilton Basso, The View from Pompey's Head, 1954
The past participle is common in the idiomatic phrases
get rid o/and be rid of:
. . . a desire of serfs to get rid of the feudalism that
has held them in a vise —William O. Douglas, Saturday Rev., 23 Apr. 1955
The liberals wished to get rid of sectarian injustices
—Conor Cruise O'Brien, N. Y. Rev. of Books, 6 Nov.
1969
. . . were willing to sacrifice everything in order to be
rid of slavery —Henry Seidel Canby, Walt Whitman, 1943
. . . desired nothing in the world so much as to be rid
of us —Katherine Anne Porter, The Never-Ending
Wrong, 1977
At one time rid was commonly used with from, but
this combination now seldom occurs:
. . . the most effective combinations for ridding sandflies from houses —Experiment Station Record,
August 1939
In this context, rid essentially means "to remove completely." The more likely construction in current
English would be "ridding houses of sandflies," where
rid means "to make free; relieve."
right 1. This old and homely adverb (many of its senses go back to the time of King Alfred the Great) has
bothered commentators—primarily American commentators—for about a century and a half. A number of
senses have been found objectionable—often for being
Americanisms or colloquialisms. Among the uses criticized are those illustrated here:
Michael was not going to strangle her right here —
Daphne du Maurier, Ladies' Home Jour., August
1971
McCarthyism came right at the end of World War II
—David Halberstam, New Times, 16 May 1975
You can drive your car right through the area where
the animals roam free —Polly Bradley, Massachusetts Audubon, June 1968
. . . right now there are people that are willing to
accept compromise —William Faulkner, 16 May
1957, in Faulkner in the University, 1959
I think I had better describe her right away —Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita, 1958
He always went right ahead with his description of
the violence he would do Uncle Andrew's assailant
—Peter Taylor, The Old Forest and Other Stories,
1985
These uses are of course standard, and they are little disputed today, although Longman 1988 considers them
more appropriate to speech than to writing, and Perrin
& Ebbitt 1972 and Ebbitt & Ebbitt 1982 say they are
common in general writing but not in formal writing.
We agree with this last observation; we have plenty of
written evidence for these uses of right, but the contexts
in which they occur are not noticeably formal.
Much of the attention given to adverbial right has
concerned its use as an intensifier. This intensive use is
old, too; the OED dates it from about 1200. It has a long
literary pedigree:
I am right glad that he's so out of hope —Shakespeare, The Tempest, 1612
. .. those illustrious and right eloquent Pen-men, the
Modern Travellers —Jonathan Swift, "A Discourse
Concerning the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit,"
1710
Of his person and stature was the King
A man right manly strong
—Dante Gabriel Rossetti (in Hall 1917)
In this country, for some reason, the spoken use of
intensive right came to be a Southernism; it was
attacked as a Southern corruption by a writer in the Boston Pearl in 1836 (cited in Thornton 1912). Hall 1917
names a number of turn-of-the-century grammarians
and rhetoricians who identify it as provincial; several
more recent handbooks call it colloquial or dialectal
(especially Southern). American dialecticians identify it
with Southern and Midland speech; Raven I. McDavid,
Jr., in PADS (Publication of the American Dialect Society), April 1967, adds the Hudson Valley. Our latest
British source, Longman 1988, calls it archaic or
regional.
If intensive right can be identified as a regionalism in
speech, it is less easy to pin down in writing. Hall mentions the problem; he is perplexed as to how the comments of the rhetoricians can be squared with his examples collected from such poets as Tennyson, Browning,
Lowell, Rossetti, and Swinburne. He surmises that perhaps the literary use can be ascribed mostly to writers
who are fond of archaizing.
Our evidence is different. We have, of course, a considerable amount of fictional speech, both dialectal and
old-fashioned. And we have direct evidence from
reported speech and from letters, presumably of people
to whom Southern or Midland speech is native. The
intensive right also appears in the discursive writing of
these people.
I did not feel right comfortable for some time afterward —Mark Twain, Innocents Abroad, 1869 (A
Mark Twain Lexicon, 1938)
It is right hard to understand what he says —Ellen
Glasgow, Barren Ground, 1925
He was a man for detail, and he did a right competent job of stage management —The Autobiography
of William Allen White, 1946
ring 822 rob
It took a right smart bug to find a safe place to hide
—Frank J. Taylor, Saturday Evening Post, 26 July
1958
I am right embarassed to think every story is the best
—Flannery O'Connor, letter, 6 Mar. 1959
Again Hamilton, in the shining armor of his genius,
rides right gallantly upon the scene —Claude G.
Bowers, Jefferson in Power, 1936
I know I whine right regularly over things about our
town that are no more —Celestine Sibley, Atlanta
Constitution, 19 Sept. 1984
So far we have quoted people we either know or assume
to have been born in the Southern and Midland speech
areas. The following examples, however, appear to be
anomalous from the geographical standpoint:
. . . a right merry letter it was too —Emily Dickinson, letter, 21 Oct. 1847
I should like right well to make a longer excursion
on foot —Henry David Thoreau, A Yankee in Canada, 1866 (OED)
. . . enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion —Jack London, The Call of the Wild, 1903
And, of course, right is sometimes used, like ain 't and
allow as how, in a deliberately casual or pseudo-dialectal
style:
They are right pleased about it, too —Changing
Times, February 1952
He moved nimbly among the delegates, chanting:
"Peanuts, popcorn, chewing gum, cigars, cigarettes!"
He did right well for a lad of 11 —Newsweek, 18
June 1956
. . . a defender of the language—you remember, he
defended it right profitably in his earlier Strictly
Speaking —William Cole, Saturday Rev., 13 Nov.
1976
Oh no, they came out of the box right smartly —Paul
Zimmerman, Sports Illustrated, 12 Nov. 1983
The usage is not unknown in British English, but
more common, apparently, is an intensive adjective use
approximately equivalent to the American's real:
You can get in a right muddle of commas when lists
include phrases in apposition —Howard 1984
Clearly we do not know everything there is to know
about the intensive right. That it is in some respects a
regionalism is evident, but no simple label seems adequate to describe the range of its common use, or to
account for its use outside that range by such writers as
New England's Emily Dickinson and San Francisco's
Jack London. In practical terms, if the intensive right is
part of your native dialect, you should of course feel free
to use it without qualm when it seems appropriate, even
in writing. It has a long and honorable history and an
impressive literary background, and our evidence shows
that it is fairly common in current writing, especially in
writing that has a light and informal style.
2. Right, rightly. See WRONG, WRONGLY.
ring, rang, rung The usual past tense of ring is rang:
His voice rang around in the girdered heights of the
gymnasium —Paul Horgan, Ladies' Home Jour.,
January 1971
Josef rang for cold drinks —Irving Stone, McCall's,
March 1971
The past participle of ring is rung:
. . . as many as 479,001,600 changes can be rung —
Lois I. Woodville, Christian Science Monitor, 1 Oct.
1954
".. . She told me that you'd rung her...." —Sunday
Mirror (London), 3 Mar. 1968
Rung was also formerly in common use as an alternative past tense of ring:
The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung —John
Milton, Paradise Lost, 1667 (OED)
One with whose name the world rung —Benjamin
Disraeli, Venetia, 1837 (OED)
But this use of rung is now extremely rare in writing.
Dialect studies such as E. Bagby Atwood's A Survey of
Verb Forms in the Eastern United States (1953) have
found rung continuing in reputable spoken use as a past
tense, especially in parts of New England. Atwood
describes this use of rung as "old-fashioned," however.
rise See RAISE, RISE.
rob 1. Rob is used most often with of, when a prepositional phrase follows:
"Yes, it was wonderful," she said, but robbed the
phrase of its full effect by adding: "I didn't imagine
I could be so glad to see him again...." —Aldous
Huxley, Point Counter Point, 1928
"Remember, George, the Sons of Liberty have
already robbed me of so much freedom that I can't
risk losing more." —Kenneth Roberts, Oliver Wiswell, 1940
At funerals his mien of settled woe somehow robbed
the chief mourners of their proper eminence —Robertson Davies, Tempest-tost, 1951
His friends say that the history profession robbed the
stage of one of its most gifted mimes —C. Vann
Woodward, N.Y. Rev. of Books, 3 Dec. 1970
Once in a great while, rob occurs with from (see section
2 below):
Concave surfaces are troublesome in that they tend
to focus sound in some spots and rob sound energy
from others —James F. Nickerson, Education
Digest, March 1953
One red or green bulb .. . will not rob color from
your fish —Virginia Carlson, All Pets, July 1962
2. Rob, as used figuratively in the last two examples
above, sometimes has as its object what is stolen, as
steal would. This use is quite old, going back to the 13th
century. It is not uncommon in earlier literature:
. . . They themselves contrive
To rob the Honey and subvert the Hive.
—John Dryden, Virgil's Georgics, 1697 (OED)
The OED describes the use as now rare. It is not, indeed,
nearly as common as the other uses, and it is sometimes
considered wrong, or archaic, by commentators no
longer familiar with it. Bernstein 1958 and Harper 1975,
1985 associate the use with newspaper headlines. We
robbery 823 run
have also collected evidence of it from news broadcasts
and newspaper reports.
. . . set it afire on Sunday, then robbed $100 after the
clerk fled the flames —Springfield (Mass.) Morning
Union, 24 Feb. 1986
This is not really a misuse, since it is a continuation of
an old standard sense. Still, we find it occurring only in
news reports. It does not appear to be used at present in
other writing, except for the rare figurative use, and we
cannot recommend its cultivation.
robbery See BURGLARY, ROBBERY.
rooftop Theodore Bernstein had a definite dislike for
this word and recommended (in The Careful Writer,
1965, and elsewhere) that it always be replaced by either
housetop or roof. No other commentator has expressed
disapproval of it. It is not a new word (the OED has a
citation for it from 1611), but it was an extremely rare
one—at least in print—until about the middle of the
20th century, and it has only recently been entered in
dictionaries. Its omission from dictionaries may have
been what caused Bernstein to disapprove of it in the
first place; however, it is now a common word, universally recognized as standard. Like housetop, it refers
especially to the level surface of a flat roof:
. . . loping over the rooftops to safety in a vacant lot
—Charles Perry, Rolling Stone, 3 Aug. 1972
. . . nesting on the gravelly rooftops of shopping complexes —Elizabeth Cary Pierson, Blair & Ketchum 's
Country Jour., June 1980
Its most distinctive use is as an attributive adjective
meaning "situated or taking place on a rooftop":
. . . sitting two tables away in the rooftop nightclub
—David Butwin, Saturday Rev., 13 Nov. 1971
. . . using a rooftop observatory to track the Apollo

rules There exists in the folk memory a set of facetious grammatical rules that pop up in various places
and in various forms from time to time. They are to be
found in Harper 1985 and Einstein 1985, for example,
and in each instance the rules are ascribed to some old
newspaper editor of beloved memory. The order may
change, the phraseology may vary, but the essential idea
is always the same. The rules we show here are taken
from an article by George W. Feinstein in College
English, April 1960. We will give only the first fifteen of
his twenty rules, because they are the ones that seem to
turn up most often.
1. Each pronoun agrees with their antecedent.
2. Just between you and I, case is important.
3. Verbs has to agree with their subjects.
4. Watch out for irregular verbs which has crope
into our language.
5. Don't use no double negatives.
6. A writer mustn't shift your point of view.
7. When dangling, don't use participles.
8. Join clauses good, like a conjunction should.
9. Don't write a run-on sentence you got to punctuate it.
10. About sentence fragments.
11. In letters themes réports articles and stuff like
that we use commas to keep a string of items
apart.
12. Don't use commas, which aren't necessary.
13. It's important to use apostrophe's right.
14. Don't abbrev.
15. Check to see if you any words out.
The beauty of rules like these is that almost anybody can
come up with the same or similar ones and believe that
they are original creations. Mr. Feinstein's set is the earliest we have found in print, but similar sets have
undoubtedly been around for many years.
In the realm of language, rule is a word that the wise
tend not to bandy about. Many observers from the 18th
century to the present have pointed out the limitations
of rules as a guide to good writing:
Rules may obviate faults, but can never confer beauties —Samuel Johnson, The Idler, 19 May 1759
I think the following rules will cover most cases: .. .
(vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous —George Orwell, "Politics
and the English Language," 1946
We ought not to get so straitjacketed in "rules" that
we sacrifice vigor and clarity to form —James J. Kilpatrick, Portland Oregonian, 2 Nov. 1985
run Funny things happen to our verbs. Run results
from the coming together in Middle English of two older
verbs, an intransitive rinnan and a causative irnan. The
first of these produced the past ran and the second produced the past run. If everything had developed according to theory, we would now have, according to Lamberts 1972, a verb rin with a past singular ran, a past
plural run, and a past participle run or runnen, in the
same class of irregular verbs as ring, swim, and begin.
But things went awry in early modern English: run
replaced rin sometime around the 16th century (Lamberts says rin still survives in Scottish and Irish folk
speech). So instead of developing into rin, ran, run, the
verb developed into two patterns, run, ran, run and run,
run, run. (If you look into the OED, you will see the full
story is much more complex than this brief sketch
reveals.)
In terms of current usage, the problem with this verb
centers on the past run. It appears in literature from the
16th to the 19th centuries; Jespersen 1909-49 (volume
6) lists Shakespeare, Bunyan, Defoe, Swift, Fielding, and
Goldsmith as using it. Modern dialectologists, such as
Michael I. Miller (American Speech, Summer 1984),
attest its currency in speech in both southern England
and in parts of the U.S. But ran is now virtually theonly
form used in writing. Modern practice may be partly
attributable to Johnson's Dictionary (1755), where only
ran is listed for the past. Lowth 1762 attacked past run,
and the tradition in school grammars ever since has
been to insist on ran. Noah Webster 1828 gave ran or
run, departing from Johnson, and his successors
run-on sentences 824 salad days
through 1909 followed suit. Webster's Second, however,
called run dialectal, and Webster's Third calls it nonstandard. Miller feels this treatment misrepresents the
usage of past run, and perhaps it does to some extent.
But dictionaries find it hard to devise a short descriptor
that will mean "used in speech in southern England and
in the southern U.S. and New England, especially by
older people, and used formerly in literature."
In any case, there is no denying that past run is now
considered nonstandard by many people, if not by
dialectologists. The surveys of Leonard 1932 and Crisp
1971 indicate as much. If it is part of your natural
speech, you should not avoid it. But you will want to
use ran in writing, as just about everyone now does.
run-on sentences See COMMA FAULT.
sacrilegious For obvious reasons, it is easy to misspell this word as sacreligious. One way to avoid the
error is to remember that religious and sacrilegious are
not etymologically related to each other. Religious is
derived from the Latin word religio, meaning "reverence, religion," whereas sacrilegious is derived ultimately from the Latin combining form sacr-, meaning
"sacred," and the verb légère, meaning "to steal." The
Latin noun sacrilegus means "one who steals sacred
things." It also may be helpful to remember that sacrilegious is the adjective formed from sacrilege.
Sahara, Sahara desert Because the Arabic word
Sahara (or sahrd) means literally "desert," several commentators, notably Bernstein 1958, Bremner 1980, and
Harper 1975, 1985, have criticized Sahara desert as a
redundancy. If English and Arabic were one language,
the critics might have a good argument, but the fact is
that Sahara in English is no more a synonym for desert
(except in figurative use) than are Gobi and Mojave; it
is, instead, the specific name of a specific desert, one that
is commonly and idiomatically called both "the Sahara"
and "the Sahara desert." Some writers do make a point
of omitting desert after Sahara, but many others do not,
and there is no reason why you should feel compelled
to.
. . . so the Sahara desert had to form —David Attenborough, TV broadcast, 2 Nov. 1987
The story within the story is set in the Sahara Desert
—Booklist, 1 June 1982
It is interesting to note that the Mongolian word gobi
means literally "waterless place," so that the same logic
that finds redundancy in Sahara desert should also find
it in Gobi desert. As far as we know, however, no one
has ever called Gobi desert redundant.

said All commentators agree that use of said as an
adjective synonymous with aforementioned is appropriate only in legal and business contexts, and it is certainly
true that it now appears far more commonly in those
contexts than in any other:
. . . fixed sinking fund requirements and final maturity amount on the said bonds —Annual Report,
Armco Steel Corp., 1970
. . . an order rescinding the supplemental agreement
referred to in said Note —Annual Report, R. J. Reynolds Industries, Inc., 1970
Said has been favored in legal writing for centuries, but
its use in general contexts was also unremarkable once:
The said article is so very mild and sentimental —
Lord Byron, letter, 22 Aug. 1813
. . . attending them to their carriage after the said
dinner visit —Jane Austen, Mansfield Park, 1814
And so you don't agree with my view as to said photographer? —Lewis Carroll, letter, 1 Apr. 1887
Such usage still occurs, but the legalistic connotations of
said have long been so familiar that those who employ
it in other contexts typically do so for deliberate effect,
often humorous:
This petition sheweth that the best way of proving
clearly that a man is not dead is by setting forth his
manner of life, and, first, that he, the said W. Hazlitt,
has regularly for the last month rang the bell at
eleven at night —William Hazlitt, letter, 11 Jan.
1808
He was also an extremely vain man who would keep
said mustache at the proper rakish tilt with the aid
of paper clips —Richard Freedman, N.Y. Times
Book Rev., 28 Mar. 1976
sake Fowler 1926 and Evans 1957 both regard the
apostrophe as optional in for goodness' sake, for conscience' sake, and similar expressions in which the word
preceding sake ends in an s or z sound. They both consider it incorrect to add an apostrophe plus -s. Our evidence indicates that the apostrophe is rarely omitted in
such expressions, and that the apostrophe plus -s is only
avoided when the \s \ sound is never added in speech,
as when the expression is a fixed idiom (as for goodness'
sake and for conscience' sake are), or when the word in
question is multisyllabic (as in for convenience' sake) so
that pronouncing the -s would be especially awkward.
When the word is short and no fixed idiom is involved,
the -s is likely to be pronounced and the apostrophe plus
-5 is likely to be written: for peace's sake, for the human
race's sake.
salad days Shakespeare coined this term in Antony
and Cleopatra (1607), wherein Cleopatra dismisses her
former love of Caesar as having occurred in "My salad
days, when I was green in judgment...." Modern writers have taken up the figure of speech, and salad days is
often now used to mean "a time of youthful inexperience":
The Paris student is a notorious rebel in his salad
days —James P. O'Donnell, Saturday Evening Post,
19 Jan. 1957
same 825 sanatorium
When a starlet was promoted to star, she immediately set about changing her image.... The salad
days were never much remembered, certainly not
talked about —Esquire, February 1976
In recent years, we have seen the development of a new
sense of salad days, "an early flourishing period;
heyday":
. . . a rundown pub that had seen its salad days at the
turn of the century —Horace Sutton, Saturday Rev.,
30 Oct. 1971
. . . the way Coward himself in his salad days could
sing them with an .. . enormously insinuating phrasing —Alan Rich, New York, 19 Feb. 1973
Those were Sahl's salad days, when The New Yorker
did a worshipful profile —Jean Shepherd, N.Y.
Times Book Rev., 3 Oct. 1976
A few usage commentators have taken note of salad
days, and none of them have much cared for it. Fowler
1926 was inclined to think it was "fitter for parrots' than
for human speech"; Evans 1957 found it "wilted."
Bremner 1980 quotes Evans; Copperud 1980 believes
the phrase is growing quaint and disused. These examples indicate otherwise:
Our reading life has its salad days, its autumnal
times —William H. Gass, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 1
Apr. 1984
. . . had not put together two good seasons since his
salad days of 1972 and '73 —Mickey Herskowitz,
Golf Digest, August 1983
same The use of same as a pronoun, often with the,
has attracted criticism from many commentators, dating back to Vizetelly 1906. The use of same as a substitute for it, this, that, and them is typically described as
unliterary business jargon, if not as an out-and-out
error. But a look at the long history and current use of
the pronoun same shows clearly that the judgment of
the critics is undeservedly harsh. Same has been in continuous use as a pronoun since the 14th century. It was
well known to the Shakespearean businessman:
And in the instant that I met with you
He had of me a chain. At five o'clock
I shall receive the money for the same.
—Shakespeare, The Comedy of Errors, 1593
But its use has never been limited to the world of business. Here are some further examples, old and new, to
counter the dismissal of pronominal same as mere
jargon:
Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings,
and from time to time publish the same —Constitution of the United States, 1787
It then transpired that Old Crockford was a village,
and, from the appearance of the team on the day of
battle, the Old Crockfordians seemed to be composed exclusively of the riff-raff of same —P. G.
Wodehouse, Tales of St Austin's, 1903
. . . mentioning the receipt of the same and stating
that no great harm had been done by the delay —
William Hazlitt, letter, 7 Apr. 1822

Illustrated, 31 Dec. 1979
He also discusses the wisdom, or lack of same, of
candor —Geneviève Stuttaford, Publishers Weekly,
7 Sept. 1984
The pronoun same may sound wooden in an awkwardly
written business letter, but in the hands of a competent
writer it is often simply a mark of an informal style.
same as 1. Several usage books, dating back to Krapp
1927, have warned against using the same as as an
adverbial phrase in place of as or just as ("He acts the
same as he used to" instead of" .. . just as he used to").
No particular reasons are given for the warnings, but
they are presumably attributable to the elliptical and
somewhat informal quality of adverbial the same as:
Black folks have a right to hate white folks the same
as white folks have a right to hate us —Dick Gregory, Avant Garde, January 1969
Writers were at each other's throats in the thirties the
same as they are today —Granville Hicks, American
Scholar, Summer 1966
As and just as are more common in writing than the
same as, but the same as is not incorrect. Note that it is
actually more flexible in its application than is just as,
in that the same in the phrase can be qualified:
. . . function much the same as they did five hundred
centuries ago —David R. Reuben, M.D., McCall's,
March 1971
2. Another old controversy—a nearly dead issue now,
though mentioned in Longman 1984—has to do with
whether a clause following same should be introduced
by as rather than that. Both are in fact in reputable use:
. . . decades to get the same amount of information
as they are gathering —Thomas L. Barnett, quoted
in N.Y. Times, 9 Aug. 1973
. . . much the same acclaim that welcomed the book
—Current Biography, March 1968
sanatorium, sanitarium People used to write letters
to newspapers—and to dictionary editors—about these
two words, but the small controversy that once existed
concerning their use has now died out. The argument
favoring a distinction between them ran more or less as
follows: sanatorium is derived from the Latin verb san-
sanguinary 826 satisfy
are, meaning "to restore to health," and properly refers
to an establishment set up for the treatment of disease
or for the care of invalids; sanitarium, on the other
hand, is derived from the Latin noun sanitas, meaning
"health," and properly refers to an establishment set up
for the preservation rather than the restoration of
health—a health resort, in other words. The problem for
those who favored this tidy etymological distinction was
that it bore no relation to actual English usage. As is now
generally conceded, sanatorium and sanitarium are synonymous words, used interchangeably. The only distinctions that can be made on the basis of the evidence
in our files are that sanatorium is somewhat more likely
to be used when the establishment referred to is specifically for the treatment of tuberculosis, and that sanitarium—possibly because of association with sanity—is
somewhat more likely when the establishment is for the
treatment of mental and emotional disorders.
sanguinary See BLOODY.
sans This French preposition meaning "without" was
borrowed into English in the 14th century and occurs
fairly commonly today, but it has never entirely lost its
Frenchness. It might have passed into disuse long ago
were it not for the influence of Shakespeare, who used it
in many of his plays, most memorably in As You Like
7/(1600):
Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
Modern writers still occasionally echo this famous
passage:
I had forgotten .. . that this was wartime; sans Salts,
sans fish, sans nets, sans sails, sans everything —
Gladys Bronwyn Stern, Trumpet Voluntary, 1944
But sans also frequently occurs when no allusion to
Shakespeare is being made. In its most typical use, its
object is a regular noun rather than a pronoun or gerund, and the a, an, or the which would normally occur
after without is dropped:
Most rooms on Hotel Circle in Mission Valley, sans
waterbed, go for just $12 —David Butwin, Saturday
Rev., 10 July 1971
. . . was named as a special assistant to the Presidentelect, sans press title —David Wise, Esquire, May
1973
Negotiations ensued and the ad finally did run, sans
marijuana leaf —Laurel LefF, Wall Street Jour., 4
June 1981
Because it still retains much of its foreign quality,
sans often appears in italics. Even when it is in roman
type, however, sans is an unusual word, one that calls
attention to itself. It occurs much more commonly in
writing than in speech, but if you do have occasion to
say it, be advised that its usual pronunciation in English
is VsanzY
sartorial Sartorial is a dressy word in more ways
than one, and its use may elicit a few grumbles from
those who scorn dressiness in language. Two such scorners among usage writers are Fowler 1926, who classes
sartorial as "pedantic humor," and Flesch 1964, who
dismisses it as "fancy." Anyone determined to avoid its
use, however, will have to contend with the fact that it
has no synonym, fancy or plain. There are times when
sartorial (or sartorially) is the only word that fits, and
there are other times when a little dressiness may not be
such a bad thing:
. . . he observes the preparations of a sartorial dandy
—Richard Poirier, A World Elsewhere, 1966
I use the tie to push me over the edge when I am at
my sartorial greatest —E. B. White, letter, 9 Jan.
1967
Can anyone deny that the appeal of films about the
Nazis is partly sartorial? —Anthony Burgess, Saturday Rev., 23 June 1979
. . . on the assumption that sartorial splendor can

arrangements —Paul Hofmann, N. Y. Times, 4 May
1980
. . . divide the delegates into groups sartorially, alcoholically, and conversationally —New Yorker, 18
July 1964
He stands out sartorially, too —Martin Mayer, N. Y.
Times Mag., 7 Feb. 1965
. . . a sartorially impressive figure —Robert Penn
Warren, Jefferson Davis Gets His Citizenship Back,
1980
sated, satiated Both sated and satiated are idiomatically followed by with:
... tend to be quickly sated with tales involving
fame or wealth —Norman Cousins, Saturday Rev.,
24 June 1978
. . . went and went again, never satiated with the
theme —Robert Morss Lovett, All Our Years, 1948
satisfy
"Satisfied" is straying, is pushing into the place long
filled properly by "convinced" or even the lowly
"sure." The result is sometimes startling. For
instance: "The man's family is satisfied that he was
murdered." Of course that may be literally true, but
the family did not mean to tell the world so —Alice
Hamilton, M.D., Atlantic, September 1954
A look in the OED shows that satisfy has been used
in a sense essentially synonymous with convince since at
least 1520. {Convince itself was first recorded in this
sense in 1606.) It has occurred in the works of such writers as Shakespeare, John Locke, Henry Fielding, Francis
Bacon, Jane Austen, Thomas Macaulay, and Charles
Lamb:
Keeping them up till midnight... would, I am satisfied, in a medical point of view, prove the better
caution —Charles Lamb, The Essays ofElia, 1823
Samuel Johnson duly recorded it as a standard sense in
1755, and so did Noah Webster in 1828. In the late 19th
century, however, it had the misfortune of being noticed
by Alfred Ayres, who was reported (in the Inland
Printer, October 1899) to regard it as "unnecessary."
20th-century criticism has been sporadic. Whipple 1924
states flatly that satisfy "should not be used as a synonym for convince.'''' Evans 1957 concurs with that opin-
saturate 827 saving
ion, but Gowers in Fowler 1965 acknowledges the long
history of the sense, limiting his criticism to what he
regards as its overuse in contexts where its suggestion of
contentment may seem inappropriate.
The "convince" sense of satisfy continues in fairly
common use, and there is no doubt that it is entirely
reputable. You may wish to avoid it in certain contexts,
as Gowers recommends, but keep in mind that satisfy
and convince have different connotations and are not
always interchangeable. Such a sentence as "The man's
family is satisfied that he was murdered" may seem
ludicrous taken out of context, but making it "The
man's family is convinced that he was murdered"
results in a significant change in meaning. Convinced
implies an utter certainty which may or may not have a
sound basis ("All the evidence suggests an accident, but
the man's family is convinced that he was murdered").
Satisfied emphasizes certainty less strongly; it implies a
realization that doubts (or hopes) have been shown by
the evidence to be unreasonable or groundless ("After
seeing the evidence, the man's family is satisfied that he
was murdered").
saturate When saturate is followed by a preposition,
the usual choice is with:
... Soviet trading missions abroad were so saturated
with intelligence agents .. . —Hedrick Smith, Atlantic, December 1974
. . . have an easy time saturating the marketplace
with their potboilers —Norman Cousins, Saturday
Rev., 24 June 1978
. . . his books .. . are saturated with politics —Irving
Howe, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 24 Oct. 1982
Other prepositions that occasionally occur after saturate
are by and in:
... saturated by prejudice and emotion —William J.
Reilly, Life Planning for College Students, 1954
. . . children are so saturated by television —Michèle
Murray, Children's House, Summer 1970
A moment ago, he was saturated in sunniness —Liz
Smith, Cosmopolitan, May 1975
. . . are they not .. . saturated in Christian cosmology? —John Updike, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 23 May
1976
When the object of saturate is a reflexive pronoun, the
preposition that follows is in:
... saturated himself in literature about, and photographs of, Nijinsky —Walter Terry, Saturday Rev.,
13 Nov. 1976
. . . will allow athletic types to saturate themselves in
basketball, volleyball, and skating —Richard F. Shepard, N.Y. Times, 10 Dec. 1976
savant Savant is not a remarkably common word,
but it does have a wide range of applications. It can be
used seriously to denote a person of great knowledge
and brilliance:
The volume demonstrates the savant's great learning, depth of understanding and ease of presentation
—British Book News, December 1965
But it can also mean little more than "one who is in the
know":
It is this particular window .. . that industry savants
believe holds the key to the fiscal future —Kenneth
Turan, TV Guide, 20 July 1984
And it often has a strongly ironic—or even sarcastic—
quality:
. . . in reading, say, a book review by one of the
apple-cheeked savants of the quarterlies or one of the
pious gremlins who manufacture puns for Time —
John Updike, in Five Boyhoods, ed. Martin Levin,
1962
This variability of tone and meaning seems to have
played some part in provoking occasional criticism by
usage commentators. Copperud 1964, for one, considers
savant in many of its uses to be journalese.
Savant has recently developed a new sense that
deserves to be noted. The term idiot savant has long
been used in medical parlance to describe a person who
is mentally deficient but exhibits great talent or brilliance in a particular field, such as music or mathematics. The term is not meant to be offensive in any way,
but idiot is such a strongly derogatory word that its use
in this term seems needlessly cruel to many people, and
the tendency in recent years has been to use savant by
itself:
It is not even clear who qualifies as a savant, nor is
it easy to tell the difference between a mentally
retarded savant and an autistic savant —Richard
Restak, Science 82, May 1982
saving, savings Savings has several familiar uses. It
occurs as a mass noun, plural in construction, with the
sense "money put by (as in a bank)":
Savings have a deflationary effect, since they cut
down the amount of spending for consumer goods
—Albert H. Sayer et al., Economics in Our Democracy, 1950
It is also used in this sense as an attributive adjective in
such terms as savings account and savings bank:
... fulfill the function of deposit and savings banks
through their numerous branches —George J.
Henry, Forbes, 1 Dec. 1970
These uses are straightforward and uncontroversial. The
problems for savings arise when it is used as a singular
noun with the sense "an act or instance of economizing"
or "reduction in cost." We first recorded this use in the
1940s, and we have encountered it with increasing frequency in the decades since:
. . . resulting in an actual cash savings on your taxes
—N.Y. Herald Tribune Book Rev., 15 Dec. 1946
. . . would represent a savings of 183,000 miles a year
—Buffalo Courier Express, 24 Apr. 1963
. . . a savings which can be passed on to you —advt.,
N.Y. Times Mag., 27 Sept. 1964
. . . up to a 25 minute time savings on each inbound
trip —John D. Caplan, Annual Report, General
Motors Corp., 1971
. . . buy one now at a $275 savings —radio advt., 16
May 1974
say 828 scarcely
A savings of space becomes a savings in money —
Steve Lambert, Apple Computer Publication, July
1984
A few usage commentators (notably Bernstein 1965 and
Safire 1986) are emphatic in disapproving this use of
savings, and the usage panelists of Heritage 1969, 1982
and of Harper 1975, 1985 reject it in writing. Nevertheless, it is extremely common and has clearly established
itself as idiomatic in American English. If you feel inclined to avoid it, you can always use saving instead:
. . . a saving of approximately $60,000,000 a year —
Current Biography, January 1965
. . . can be purchased at a saving of up to 60% —
Caleb Pirtle III, Southern Living, November 1971
A related concern is the use of savings in daylight savings time. The original term, and the usual term in writing, is daylight saving time, but daylight savings time (or
often just daylight savings) is very common in speech,
and it does occasionally make its way into print:
. . . upheld the validity of the Massachusetts daylight-savings time law —George W. Hervey & Reign
S. Hadsell, Inspection & Control of Weights & Measures in the USA, May 1942
He called this idea Daylight Savings Time —Joseph
M. Oxenhorn et al., Pathways in Science (textbook),
1982
Usage commentators who take up this subject regard
daylight savings time as an error.
say The use of say for said in a narration, as in says
I, is now and then pointed to as an error. There are two
aspects of the problem: the use of the third person singular says with first and second person pronouns, and
the use of the present where the past might be expected.
Curme 1931 explains the first as a survival of older literary English. When the Northern -s was in the process
of replacing the Southern -th ending in early Modern
English, it was not limited to just the third person singular. (It had been used for all persons in Northern dialect.) The survival of this older form in the says I of the
narrator is a mark of a conversational style of narration.
It is used to identify the narrator's speech as distinct
from the rest of the narrative and the speech of interlocutors. Curme has an example from one of Thackeray's
less serious works. Here are a few from our own files:
Why, says I, this is a little Nosegay of Conceits, a
very Lump of Salt: Every Verse hath something in it
that piques.... Dear Mr. Bickerstaff, says he, shaking me by the Hand, every Body knows you to be a
Judge of these Things —Joseph Addison, The Tatler,
No. 163, 25 Apr. 1710
But I was going to tell what husband said. He says to

he. 'Th' same to you, an' manny iv thim,' says I, fondlin' me own ammunition —Finley Peter Dunne,
Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War, 1898
One of them in Texas fixed me with a seedy eye and
said, "Miss O'Connor, what is your motivation in
writing?" "Because I'm good at it," says I —Flannery O'Connor, letter, 24 Nov. 1962
The use of the present where the past might be expected
appears to add a certain immediacy to the narration.
Such usage is fine in a chatty, colloquial style, even
though a bit iffy by modern grammatical standards. You
will not, of course, use it in your high-powered, dead
serious prose.
scan The case of scan is a bit unusual. In the 20th century it has developed a new sense which—on the face of
it—seems directly contradictory to one of its older
senses, but almost no one seems to mind. The older
sense is "to examine thoroughly and carefully." It was
first recorded in about 1800, and continues in use today:
Conscious of handwritings now, she scanned Eden's
carefully —Herman Wouk, Marjorie Morningstar,
1955
The newer, and now more common, sense of scan is "to
look over or glance through quickly," which was first
recorded in the 1920s:
. . . he approached the letter boxes and quickly
scanned the nameplates —Bernard Malamud, Atlantic, March 1973
I scanned the story rapidly and felt a little better —
Russell Baker, Growing Up, 1982
The contradiction in these uses of scan is not as extreme
as it may appear. The fundamental, underlying sense in
both cases is that the eyes are moving from point to
point. They may be moving slowly and searchingly,
carefully taking in every detail ("The lookout scanned
the horizon"), or they may be moving quickly, looking
only for points of particular interest ("He scanned the
morning paper before breakfast"), but the idea of movement is always primary.
Criticism of scan in its "look over quickly" sense has
been limited to British commentators, such as Partridge
1942 and Phythian 1979. British dictionaries, on the
other hand, now treat this sense as standard. American
commentators, including Evans 1957 and Bernstein
1971, note its apparent inconsistency with the older
sense, but regard it as established and acceptable nevertheless. Heritage 1969 suggests that care should be taken
to assure that the context makes clear which sense is
intended. This is usually accomplished by the use of
adverbs, such as carefully, quickly, and rapidly in the
passages quoted above.
scarcely 1. Scarce, scarcely. Several commentators
have disparaged as an affectation the use of the old flat
adverb scarce in modern contexts where scarcely would
also do. The flat adverb was once common:
. . . the gentlemen of the next age will scarce have
learning enough to claim the benefit of the clergy —
Thomas Shadwell, The Virtuoso, 1676
. . . allow his surgeon scarce time sufficient to dress
his wound —Laurence Sterne, Tristram Shandy,
1759
But it is now relatively rare. The extent to which it
is an affectation in a particular context can only be
scarcely... than 829 scared
judged subjectively. These examples do not seem to be
affected:
Store money was predicated on handling the products of the community, something scarce any store
does nowadays —John Gould, Christian Science
Monitor, 19 Nov. 1976
. . . I could scarce see the horses' tails —J. K. Milne,
Scottish Field, April 1974
Se e FLAT ADVERBS.
2. Scarcely is lumped with hardly (which see) in quite a
few usage books as a negative, and its use with a preceding negative is disparaged as a double negative. There
are two points to be made concerning this issue. First,
scarcely is not a negative. Obviously "I scarcely studied" and "I didn't study" do not mean the same thing;
the second is a negative, the first only somewhat like a
negative. Second, the criticized construction seems to be
rare in present-day English. Here is a late 19th-century
example:
. . . it wa' n't scarcely fair to keep it all to myself —
H. N. Westcott, "The Horse Trader," 1898, in The
Mirth of a Nation, ed. Walter Blair & Raven I.
McDavid,Jr., 1983
Our files do not hold recent examples of this sort of construction, even from reported or fictional speech, and we
suspect that it is not nearly as common as similar constructions with hardly, for which we have abundant
evidence.
On the other hand, scarcely is commonly followed by
some sort of negative construction:
. . . was scarcely unaware that a last great tribute to
the world-famous composer could not fail to bring
. . . a large number of visitors —Francis Steegmuller,
New Yorker, 1 May 1971
. . . there was scarcely an old family in New England
which .. . did not profit from the slave trade —Chester Bowles, NY. Times Mag., 1 Feb. 1954
There is scarcely a peroration or passage .. . which
does not contain a gibe —Richard M. Weaver, The
Ethics of Rhetoric, 1953
No one objects to these standard constructions.
scarcely .. . than The sequence scarcely ... when is
considered impeccable by all commentators:
Scarcely had Ida May recovered .. . when she heard
a loud, bumptious knocking at her door —Katherine
Anne Porter, Ladies' Home Jour., August 1971
David had scarcely rung the bell when the door flew
open —Agnes Sligh Turnbull, The Gown of Glory,
1951
This sequence means about the same as no sooner . . .
than. The combining of no sooner. . . than with scarcely
. . . when produces the syntactic blend scarcely. . . than,
which has been denounced as an error since at least the
1880s (see SYNTACTIC BLEND). Hodgson 1889 has several
examples, including these:
Scarcely had she gone, than Clodius and several of
his gay companions broke in upon him —Edward
Bulwer-Lytton, The Last Days of Pompeii, 1834
But, as it happened, scarcely had Phoebe's eyes
rested again on the judge's countenance than all its
ugly sternness vanished —Nathaniel Hawthorne,
The House of the Seven Gables, 1851
If the examples in Hodgson are a reliable guide,
scarcely. .. than was quite common in the 19th century.
(It had been noticed as early as Priestley 1798, in which
an example from Smollett is given.) The 20th century
appears to be another story. Fowler 1926 exhibits one
example, and Bryant 1962 has another, taken from a
1940 Reader's Digest. Our files contain nothing further.
It may be that a century of disapproval (the subject can
be found in Longman 1988 and Trimmer & McCrimmon 1988) has had a discouraging effect, or it may be
that the construction has simply fallen into disuse quite
on its own. Whatever the reason, on the basis of our evidence it is hard to say that the sequence has ever really
established itself but equally hard to say that it poses a
significant problem for writers now.
See HARDLY .. . THAN for a similar syntactic blend.
scared 1. When used with a preposition, scared is
most often followed by of:
I am scared of rats —Graham Greene, Another Mexico, 1939
He tells us as much about the Presidency as he does
about the C.I.A., and he leaves me scared stiff of
both —John le Carré, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 14 Oct.
1979
".. . I think he was scared of what you'd say to him,
that's why he took off." —John Updike, New Yorker,
28 Dec. 1981
It is also used quite commonly with about, at, and by:
. . . a weak government allows bigger wage increases
than it ought to; then it gets scared about them —
The Economist, in Atlas, December 1969
Many Democrats were scared stiff at the prospect of
being out of step with the mood of the country —
Tip O'Neill with William Novak, Man of the House,
1987
. . . obviously scared by the prestige and the mass
base the Communists built up during the war —
Alfred Kazin, Partisan Rev., May 1948
Scared is also followed by to and the infinitive:
I ain't laughed so much since the time John Potter
got on the bear's back without no knife, and rode
him round like a hoss, and was scared to get off! —
William C. Hall, "How Sally Hooter Got Snakebit,"
1850, in The Mirth of a Nation, ed. Walter Blair &
Raven I. McDavid, Jr., 1983
What they said to him was that he was a country boy
in the city, scared to go out on the street —Peter Taylor, The Old Forest and Other Stories, 1985
2. The combination scared of has been disparaged by a
handful of commentators (Vizetelly 1906, Krapp 1927,
Weseen 1928, Partridge 1942, and Freeman 1983), all of
whom have recommended afraid in place of scared. The
earlier examples and these that follow show that it is
standard. It is more common in speech—real and fictional—and in casual and informal prose than it is in
highly serious writing. It may have originated as an
scarify 830 scenario
Americanism (its exact origin is uncertain), but it is now
used in both American and British English.
. . . I'd be as scared of snakes if we did it every night
for a year —Ernest Hemingway, Green Hills of
Africa, 1935
. . . the experienced Georgia Sothern, who doesn't
look at all scared of anything —George Jean Nathan,
The Entertainment of a Nation, 1942
Americans seem less scared .. . of some European
countries than others —The Economist, 26 Apr.
1986
scarify Scarify is really two words, the older of which,
first attested in 1541, has the basic meaning "to make
scratches or cuts in." It has several literal applications:
Some seeds .. . may need special treatment, such as
scarifying .. . to make them more penetrable to
water —C. H. Wadleigh, in The Yearbook of Agriculture 1957: Soil
.. . burning over or scarifying the ground, then planting seedlings —John J. Putnam, National Geographic, April 1974
Men and women have been beautifying, scarifying
and mutilating their bodies .. . since the dawn of
time —Matilda Traherne, Times Literary Supp., 7
Mar. 1980
And it is sometimes used figuratively:
. . . this is the Nixon .. . that Garry Wills (in his fascinating book) scarifies as a human being —William
F. Buckley, Jr., National Rev., 26 Jan. 1971
The newer scarify, with a meaning somewhere
between "scare" and "terrify," was first recorded almost
200 years ago:
. . . I have little doubt but the Weomen and Children
would be scarified out of part of their senses —A.
Thomas, Newfoundland Jour., 1794 (OED Supplement)
But the next evidence of its use dates from the end of
the 19th century, and it is only in the past 50 years or so
that this new scarify has begun to appear commonly in
print. It is an inconspicuous word in some ways,
because it occurs most often in the form of the present
participle, scarifying, used as an adjective in contexts
which sometimes fail to make its meaning clear. Our
files contain enough clear-cut examples, however, to
show that the newer scarify is now in widespread, standard use. Here are some of those examples:
. . . vivid snapshots of the Paris barricades .. . and a
few scarifying pictures of both sides' firing squads —
Times Literary Supp., 30 Sept. 1965
. . . with two bullet holes in his car and a scarifying
tale to go with them —Peter Goldman, Newsweek,
15 July 1968
. . . the disquieting life style of rock groups and audiences—the hair, the costumes, the volume, scarifying hints of sexual liberation —Benjamin DeMott,
NY. Times Mag., 25 Aug. 1968
. . . dire, scarifying illustrations of what can happen
to kids who have the habit —Arthur Knight, Saturday Rev., 2 Oct. 1971
It is scarifying in the opposite way from a nightmare
—Paul Theroux, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 16 Nov.
1975
Read as a cautionary tale, it's pretty scarifying —
Katha Pollitt, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 21 May 1978
Most current usage commentators have said nothing
about the new scarify, probably because they have not
noticed it yet. Exceptions are Reader's Digest 1983 and
the Oxford American Dictionary, both of which flatly
reject it, saying in effect that there is no scare in scarify.
Whether they like it or not, however, the scare is there,
and it is probably there to stay. Several contemporary
dictionaries now enter the new scarify, treating it as a
standard homograph of the older word.
scenario Scenario first attracted attention as a vogue
word in the late 1960s, not long after it had crept out of
theater and visual arts parlance into use by politicians
and government officials and by the journalists who
report what politicians and governmental officials say
and do. We first encountered it in 1967:
His scenario for a settlement envisages the eventual
reunification of Vietnam —Selig S. Harrison, New
Republic, 25 Nov. 1967
The oil industry, then, acts according to the classic
Leninist scenario —Michael Harrington, American
Power in the Twentieth Century, 1967
In these, the scenario is a sequence of events imagined,
postulated, or projected. This is the primary new use of
the word, and it is flourishing to the extent that Reader's
Digest 1983 terms it "one of the unmistakable signature
words of our period."
The early critics of scenario were journalists, but in
due time the writers of usage books joined their ranks:
Newman 1974, Howard 1977, Ebbitt & Ebbitt 1982, and
Janis 1984 all comment unfavorably. Reader's Digest
1983 and Harper 1975, 1985 explain rather than condemn. Both of them notice a use that cropped up in the
Watergate hearings, in which real people had to follow
a sort of scripted sequence of events, like the actors in a
movie. This use seems to be fairly uncommon, but it
apparently had occurred before Watergate:
The whole scenario is a recurrence of the one played
out in 1960 when McNamara had to behave as if
there were a "missile gap" to justify the campaign
myth —Arthur Blaustein, Harper's, March 1969
If the verb play out is a clue to this use, we may also
have it in the following example, although the context is
not very clear:
Ollie North put him in touch with us. He has 3 or 4
scenarios he would like to play out —William J.
Casey, in The Tower Commission Report, 1987
The popularity of scenario has brought about a further spread (some might call it metastasis) of meaning.
In these two examples from British and Australian
English, it is close in meaning to setting:
Nevertheless, Oxford is not an obvious scenario for
dramatic confrontation—Isis, 19 Oct. 1974
Stylish architect-designed concrete buildings dot the
outback scenario —Gerald Frape, Nation Rev. (Melbourne), 17 Apr. 1975
scene 831 Scotch
In the next two examples, its meaning tends toward
scene:
When leadoff hitter Steve Sax singled in the first for
Los Angeles, Carlton quickly picked him off, a scenario that would be repeated in the final game —
Ron Fimrite, Sports Illustrated, 17 Oct. 1983
John McHale, president of the Montreal Expos, said
cocaine was the reason his team did not win its division championship in 1982....
"I don't think there's any doubt in '82 that whole
scenario cost us a chance to win," McHale said —
Murray Chass, N.Y. Times, 20 Aug. 1985
The most vigorous figurative sense, however, continues
to be the original one:
It is called Seven Tomorrows, and it offers seven
possible scenarios for the 1980s and 1990s —James
Atlas, Atlantic, October 1984
Our whole budget plan, I told them, depended on the
accuracy of "Rosy Scenario," the five-year economic
forecast we had fashioned in February —David A.
Stockman, Newsweek, 28 Apr. 1986
scene The most recent extended senses of scene have
been the object of some disparagement from usage commentators. Our files show that the vogue for these senses
in the middle 1970s has fallen off considerably in the
1980s, but they are still found from time to time:
. . . the local police are powerless to control the drug
scene that flourishes in this part of the village —Kim
Waller, Town & Country, September 1983
"It's a bad scene all the way around," said Chauncy
J. Medberry, former chairman of BankAmerica
Corp. —Patrick Boyle, Los Angeles Times, 23 Sept.
1984
But come here not for the food but the crowd, which
is the ne plus ultra of the downtown scene —Elle,
May 1986
As the vogue for these senses passes and they become a
settled part of the vocabulary, they are likely to draw
less critical attention. They are certainly standard in
general writing.
sceptic See SKEPTIC, SCEPTIC.
scotch When Shakespeare wrote in Macbeth, "We
have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it," he was using
scotch to mean "to disable by wounding," a sense of the
verb that is now archaic. The current meaning of scotch
is "to put an end to."
But if the king's suspicions of Roger of Salisbury
were justified, he did well to scotch the danger while
he was still strong —Frank Barlow, The Feudal
Kingdom of England 1042-1216, 3d éd., 1972
In the process they scotch many a fable —Timothy
Ferris, N.Y. Times Book Rev., 31 July 1983
The plan was scotched in the White House —Business Week, 5 Aug. 1985
'Hopefully' we can scotch this vulgarism —Stanley
Kunitz, in Harper 1975
Fowler 1926 made the modern use of scotch an issue
when he attributed it to the carelessness of journalists,
and a few recent commentators have shown the influence of Fowler by continuing to insist that the disused
sense is the only correct one. Needless to say, the cause
is lost. The current sense of scotch is unquestionably
standard.
Scotch, Scottish, Scots Chambers 1985, which,
having been published in Scotland, would seem to be a
reasonable source for accurate and up-to-date information on this subject, says that Scottish is the normal
adjective:
. . . people whose ancestry was Scottish —William
Faulkner, 7 May 1957, in Faulkner in the University,
1959
The revival of Scottish literature —John Butt,
English Literature in the Mid-Eighteenth Century,
edited & completed by Geoffrey Carnall, 1979
In most Scottish schools —K. M. Elisabeth Murray,
Caught in the Web of Words, 1977
Scotch is used chiefly in familiar compounds for wellknown things like Scotch broth, Scotch whisky, Scotch
salmon, the Scotch pine and the Scotch terrier. Scots,
too, is restricted in application, referring mostly to law
or language.
But as a child he started writing down the Scots
words and phrases —Howard 1984
These are essentially the usages preferred by the Scots,
and these preferences have evolved over about the last
century. Earlier usage is different, as the admirably
detailed historical sketch in the OED shows. Scotch,
which is rather disliked in Scotland except in such uses
as those just mentioned, dates only from the end of the
16th century, but was the predominant adjective in the
18th and 19th centuries; it was used by such writers as
Boswell, James Beattie, Robert Burns, and Sir Walter
Scott. It was likewise used by more recent Scots, including James A. H. Murray, the OED editor; presumably
some Scots still use it.
Non-Scottish use has never quite conformed to Scottish preferences. The English, many of whom have not
been averse to needling the Scots, have kept on using
Scotch, although Reader's Digest 1983 assures us that
the politer ones use Scottish. In North America Scotch
is the prevailing adjective, at least partly because the
earlier immigrants to this continent from Scotland left
that country when Scotch was still prevalent there.
. . . Scotch rhetoricians —McKnight 1928
. . . may have so infuriated the Scotch that they all
reverted to oatmeal —Alexander Woollcott, letter,
22 Nov. 1935
He said he was part Scotch, English and Gypsy —
Groucho Marx, letter, 5 Sept. 1940
My first two books were published in England by the
Scotch and English —Robert Frost, letter, 26 July
1942
. . . a difference of opinion as to who was superior.
The Scotch believed, I have always thought rightly,
that they were —John Kenneth Galbraith, The
Scotch, 1964
If you live in the United Kingdom, you are aware of
Scottish preferences. If you live in North America, you
are likely to use Scotch automatically, especially when
sculp 832 secure
Scottish susceptibilities are not a consideration. There
is no harm, of course, in following the Scottish preferences—Scottish is, after all, the old word—both Scotch
and Scots are derived from it. There is another rule of
thumb that works fairly well for the American who does
not want to offend but does not know or want to know
the finer points of Scottish practice: use Scottish for people and Scotch for things.
sculp, sculpt, sculpture About half a century ago,
dictionaries such as the OED and Webster's Second
1934 were calling the verbs sculp and sculpt "jocular"
and "humorous." The evidence on which those labels
were based must have been primarily oral, as written
evidence from that period is scanty. It was not until the
1940s and 1950s that we began to find sculp and, in particular, sculpt in widespread written use, very little of
which was humorous:
. . . he has sculped more famous heads —Time, 27
Oct. 1941
. . . Mussolini's sculpted horses —Irwin Shaw, Yale
Rev., Summer 1944
.. . Brancusi once sculpted a wooden column of similar rhythm —Frederick J. Kiesler, Partisan Rev.,
Winter 1946
Moore, who sculpts and draws mostly figures —
Newsweek, 11 Mar. 1946
. . . sculpted works which themselves implied the
conquest of space —Horizon, December 1946
. . . was one of the fifty artists chosen .. . to paint or
sculp her portrait —Robert Gibbings, Trumpets
from Montparnasse, 1955
Citations such as these made it clear that the old labels
were no longer appropriate, and they have since been
dropped. Sculp and sculpt are now established as standard synonyms of sculpture. A few usage commentators,
particularly Bernstein 1962, 1965, have regarded them
with lingering disapproval, but most either ignore them
or find them acceptable.
search When used with a preposition, the noun
search is usually followed by for, except in the phrase in
search of:
. . . the requisite search for knowledge —Robert A.
Nisbet, Psychology Today, March 1971
. . . the growers worked hard in search of new markets —A. V. Krebs, Jr., Commonweal, 9 Oct. 1970
Shaw 1970 states that in search for is also common, but
that in search of 'is preferred. Our evidence indicates that
in search for is rare in edited prose. We have only two
examples of it, both from a single year:
. . . while in search for a title for his first book of
poems —Time, 15 Feb. 1954
. . . not the businessman in search for orders or for
the secrets of know-how —D. W. Brogan, Saturday
Rev., 17 Apr. 1954
seasonable, seasonal Whereas seasonable means
"suitable to the season" (seasonable temperatures, seasonable clothes), seasonal means "of or relating to a season; occurring in a particular season" (seasonal migration, seasonal employment). So say the usage writers,
and, according to our evidence, they speak the truth on
this matter. We do have some evidence of seasonable
being used where seasonal would be expected, but such
usage is extremely rare. The OED Supplement has a few
citations for this use (which it labels erroneous), and our
own files provide two more:
"Work in the General Motors plants here is seasonable at best," he went on —N. Y. Times, 12 Apr. 1937
. . . the business is less seasonable than in most other
countries —An Exhibition of Swiss Books, February,
March, April 1953
This use of seasonable is nonstandard.
Seasonal is sometimes used to mean "seasonable" as
well, but this use is also nonstandard. Although it occurs
fairly commonly in television and radio weather reports, we have yet to encounter it in writing.
Also to be considered, however, are the words unseasonable and unseasonal, which, as it happens, are synonyms. Unseasonable is the more common word by far,
and it means just what you would expect it to, "not seasonable." Unseasonal, however, seems never to have
meant "not seasonal." All of our evidence shows unseasonal being used to mean "not seasonable," as in the following citations:
.. . late spring frosts and unseasonal rains —Time,
10 Dec. 1945
. . . adjourned happily into the unseasonal Long
Island sunshine—Time, 17 Jan. 1949
. . . in which to store potatoes, cotton, tobacco and
the few unseasonal clothes —Max Steele, Discovery,
March 1954
Make no mistake, however—unseasonal is a very rare
word. Usage writers have not even noticed it. If they
had, you can be sure they would have called it an error.
secondly Used with some frequency in a series after
first or in the first place—by Charles Lamb and Samuel
Johnson, to name just two. See FIRSTLY.
secure Secure in the sense "to obtain by effort; gain
secure control or possession o f is recognized as legitimate by usage commentators (it has been around since
the 18th century), but it makes some of them uneasy.
Their concern is that it should not be used when a simple get or obtain would be more appropriate. Bernstein
1965 offers the following as an example of misuse: "He
went to the store to secure a package of cigarettes." It is
easy to see how a sentence like that might raise a few
eyebrows, but we have no real evidence that secure is
actually used when get or buy is so obviously called for.
In edited prose, at least, secure seems almost always to
be used in ways that even usage commentators would
find unobjectionable, with implications of effort or of
lasting possession:
He secured for the university library many outstanding private book collections —Current Biography,
April 1966
. . . the pressure to secure a job immediately after
high school —Donald McDonald, Center Mag.,
July/August 1970
. . . who failed to secure the party's nomination for
reelection —William Edgett Smith, New Yorker, 30
Oct. 1971
see 833 seldom ever
He secured the use of an army parade grounds —E.
L. Doctorow, Ragtime, 1975
see, seed, seen The standard past tense of see is saw.
American dialectologists say that the past forms see and
seed are nonstandard and regionally restricted. Both of
them were commonly used by the American dialect
humorists of the 19th century, and seed was additionally
listed as a Cockneyism as far back as 1807.
Seen as the past tense seems to be widespread but
nonstandard. There are at least two explanations for its
low status. Margaret Shaklee in Shopen & Williams
1980 says that it was a southern regionalism brought
into the north and midwest around the end of the 19th
century by southerners who migrated north looking for
work. This explanation is given some support as to
chronology by our earliest evidence for the correction of
seen, in Vizetelly 1906. Mencken 1963 (abridged), on
the other hand, associates seen with the immigration of
the Irish to the United States in the 1840s. His explanation is supported by the English Dialect Dictionary,
which calls past tense seen chiefly Irish. In either case
we see that a regional speech characteristic has turned
into a social rather than a regional marker.
Past seen, then, is a speech characteristic associated
with the less educated and is used in writing chiefly to
mark characters as being such. An example:
We had a visitor the other day, an old man, who said
he wouldn't go to Europe if they gave it to him. Said
a feller went over there and set down on some steps
he seen in front of a church .. . —Flannery O'Connor, letter, 1953
seeing, seeing as, seeing as how, seeing that
Seeing has long been used as a conjunction meaning
"inasmuch as; in view of the fact that":
They all wanted to know why—seeing I had the
same genes as Tracy—I couldn't swim as fast as she
could —Amy Caulkins, quoted in Sports Illustrated,
20 Apr. 1981
This conjunction has been in use since the 16th century,
but it does not now appear very frequently in writing. It
originally appeared as part of a compound in seeing
that, which is still used, and it also appears in the compound forms seeing as and seeing as how.
Seeing as and seeing as how are chiefly spoken forms
for which we have little written evidence. Both are
attested in American and British English (seeing as how
was noticed in debate in the House of Commons in
1961).
"Well, seeing as I like your style," he said, "I think
we might just be able to fit you in, mightn't we, Pauline?" —Alan Coren, Punch, 7 Apr. 1976
. . . haven't paid her any profuse attention, seein' as
the German girls never know what to make of it
when a person takes any notice of them —Henry
Adams, letter, 8 Nov. 1859
Seeing as how the Governor was a co-sponsor of the
original bill .. . , I've got a sneaking hunch he just
might veto this —Jim StoichefF, Priest River (Idaho)
Times, 26 Jan. 1973
Seeing that is the best attested of all four forms in
writing:
It seems to me most strange that men should fear,
Seeing that death, a necessary end
Will come when it will come
—Shakespeare, Julius Caesar, 1600
. . . inappropriate, seeing that Campanella is only
about thirty yards above sea-level —Norman Douglas, Siren Land, 1911
Seeing that his brother .. . had resigned the Lord
Lieutenancy without setting foot in Ireland, Frederick had really done well for himself —Irish Digest,
May 1952
Seeing as how is aspersed in a few handbooks as nonstandard, but it seems rather to be simply a spoken
form; we have no evidence that links it with the usage
of the uneducated. It is possible that in American use it
is geographically restricted, since our slender evidence
suggests it may be a Northern form. The Dictionary of
American Regional English will have the last word on
that question.
seek The verb seek is frequently used with after or for.
After tends to occur most often with the past participle
sought in an idiomatic passive, but active use also
occurs. For is common with all tenses and voices.
. . . he was much sought after on account of his wide
reading —Dictionary of American Biography, 1929
. . . Namath was the one collegiate player most
sought after by professional teams —Current Biography, December 1966
".. . If the effect of his behaviour does not justify
him with you, we had better not seek after the
cause." —Jane Austen, Nonhanger Abbey, 1818
These differences are by no means so evident to (or
so sought for by) a majority of peoples of non-European origin —Weston La Barre, The Human Animal, 1954
Now he learns to talk and thereby joins the Republic
of Learning, a republic composed of men who seek
for meaning —Stringfellow Barr, Center Mag.,
March 1968
Seek is also commonly followed by to and an infinitive:
We can seek to perpetuate the myths or to focus on
the real issues —Leslie H. Gelb & Morton H. Halperin, Harper's, November 1971
seem See CAN'T SEEM.
see where See where is disparaged in many usage
books, most of which identify it as a speech form.
Where is also used to introduce clauses that are the
objects of other verbs than see. See WHERE 2.
seldom ever, seldom if ever, seldom or ever, seldom or never All of these idioms are intensive forms
of seldom that have attracted a bit of attention from
usage writers over the years (from the 1860s at least).
The commentators are typically concerned with distinguishing between them or, alternatively, with reducing
the field by rejecting one or two of them. Thus we find
seldom ever criticized as redundant by one commentator, as self-contradictory by another (a contrary pair of
opinions those are), and as absurd by a third. Seldom or
ever is called meaningless or erroneous. The movement
to oust seldom or never, however, died a-borning in the
19th century; Alford 1866 reports it but defends the
phrase, and we hear no more of the complaint.
self 834 self-deprecating
Let us see how these phrases are actually used. Seldom ever, according to the OED, has been around since
about 1000; like it or not, it is a well-aged idiom. Since
we have in our files more complaints about it than
examples of its use in print, we conclude that it is more
frequently a feature of speech than of writing. Here is
one of our few written examples:
. . . consideration of curriculum is frequently postponed to some future date which seldom ever arrives
—Dayton Benjamin, American School Board Jour.,
June 1968
Seldom or ever is not attested until the 18th century.
It is perhaps a blend of seldom if ever and seldom or
never. This undated example is probably older than the
first citation in the OED:
We seldom or ever see those forsaken who trust in
God —Francis Atterbury (in Raub 1897)
If we can trust the considerable list of examples compiled by Hodgson 1889, seldom or ever must have been
quite common during the 19th century.
Those who walk in their sleep have seldom or ever
the most distant recollection that they have been
dreaming —Sydney Smith, Moral Philosophy, 1850
(in Hodgson 1889)
Seldom or ever could I detect any approach to a
labial —Alexander Ellis, Transactions of the Philological Society (in Jespersen 1917)
We have no recent 20th-century examples, but we cannot say whether this version has dropped out of use
entirely or has simply receded into speech.
Seldom or never is dated back to 1398. Francis Bacon
used it, and it is still common in the 20th century:
Younger Brothers are commonly Fortunate, but seldome or never, where the Elder are disinherited —
Francis Bacon, Essays, 1625
My interest is always in the subjective event, seldom
or never in the objective event —H. L. Mencken, letter, 23 Apr. 1911
. . . elementary school, where home assignments are
seldom or never given —Betty M. Shaw, NEA Jour.,
February 1965
Seldom if ever presents us with a bit of a problem
from the standpoint of using it with seldom or never to
explain seldom or ever as a blended form. The OED
does not happen to show any examples of it, so the earliest evidence of its use we have is Alford's comments
of 1866. It is well attested in 20th-century use:
. . . words that seldom if ever appeared in the writings of those sophisticated enough to strive for what
they regarded as standard form —Mathews 1931
But the women at work in the shipyards and other
war plants were seldom if ever called ladies —H. L.
Mencken, The American Language, Supplement I,
1945
Our knowledge of these phrases is far from complete,
but one thing that we can say with certainty now is that
seldom if ever and seldom or never are the only ones
commonly used in writing in the 20th century, and they
are subject to no rational criticism.
self Several commentators have disparaged se//used
like myself 'for / or me. Such use dates back to the 18th
century, but we have little evidence of its occurrence in
modern edited prose. Here is one example:
Self and coworkers .. . have shown that hornworms
. . . —B. C. Akehurst, Tobacco, 1968
This use of self is not an error, but it will not win you
any awards as a prose stylist.
A good deal more attention has been paid to myself
and other reflexive pronouns used in this way. See
MYSELF.
self-confessed Self-confessed has been regarded by a
few critics as a tautological substitute for confessed.
Note, however, that in typical usage the meaning of selfconfessed is closer to admitted or avowed than it is to
confessed and confessed will not always substitute for it
comfortably:
. . . a man old enough to be my father, and a selfconfessed master of English prose —Ernest Hemingway, "African Journal," 1956
That was the fate of.. . Eugene McCarthy, a selfconfessed poet —E. L. Doctorow, N.Y. Times, 11
Apr. 1976
A lifelong bachelor with a self-confessed taste for
medals —Thomas Powers, N. Y. Times Book Rev.,
21 May 1978
. . . an engaging portrait of a self-confessed maverick
—Mel Watkins, N. Y. Times Book Rev., 7 Oct. 1979

1981
self-defeating See COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, SELF-DEFEATING.
self-deprecating, self-deprecatory These adjectives are apparently of quite recent formation. They are
occasionally dragged into the dispute about deprecate
and depreciate, to the obfuscation of that issue. The earliest citation we know of for self-deprecatory is
included—without a date—in Fowler 1907, in which it
is treated as a misuse of deprecate:
In the present self-deprecatory mood in which the
English people find themselves —Spectator
